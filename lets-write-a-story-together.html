          <div class="flow-body"><h2>Dear Reader,</h2>
          <p>How often have you wished to be part of global narrative, if not script a story yourself. As a storyteller, I see purpose in helping you walk through your talk.</p>

<p>So, here we go…</p>

<p>Come, open the floodgates to your imagination and think the most beautiful thoughts that transport you to the magic realm of writing right through this portal.</p>

<p>Go, pick up your pen, your stylus, or better still, hammer away at your keyboard, to let the words flow out of your mind as we craft the world’s most fascinating story ever.</p>

<p>Come, join me as we marshall the world’s greatest army of storytellers imaginable to script the world’s greatest story of all times to come.</p>

<p>Difficult?</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>Register yourself at this portal and download your stream of our collective conscience, one person at a time.</p>

<p>Remember, the world’s best stories are no-holds-barred. Yet, there is need for decorum, keeping the collective sensitivities of our collective in mind. So, while the choice of words must be entirely yours, let’s ensure that we hurt no one.</p>

<p>Also remember, brevity of expression is the quintessential attribute of the best storytellers. So, limit your post to a hundred words at a time. You are free to write as often as you desire, and join the stream anywhere through its long and meandering course. Yet, it’s also our privilege to ensure that the string of thoughts flowing from the several likes of you and I here is not broken.</p>

<p>Is that asking for too much?</p>

<p>Not really, if we remember that it is alright for the an interesting narrative to take unanticipated twists and turns. Like the several rivulets that make a stream, and the several streams that make a river, and the several rivers that make an ocean, and the several oceans that rise up to the sky, all at once, seeking to kiss the sun, let’s all come together surfing our digital consciousness, to create a fantastic universe where no human imagination has travelled before.</p>

<p>Let us be the wayfarers who chart the path to the future through this journey, bridging chasms left behind by cultures, creeds and civilisations. It’s for us to build this bridge.</p>

<p>So, come, let’s start where all stories must start one day…</p>
