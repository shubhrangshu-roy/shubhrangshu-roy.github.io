without that wears not in arms, burns not in fire,<br>
soaks not in rain, dries not in wind, <br>
for it cannot be pierced or burnt or drenched or dried <br>
without doubt all pervasive, stationed, stable,<br>
eternal, unmoved by senses, forever unchanging,<br>
forever dying, forever born, in death of birth of the unborn, <br>
born no other way, but this!

are rewarded or discarded by The Divine.<br>
Then alone will MISRULE and MISGOVERNANCE<br>
cease in the land and I will gradually be <br>
DELIVERED towards acquiring Divine Grace <br>
in an ORDERLY and MORAL environment.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihhvm6eLWZI">Make me a channel of your peace</a><br>
Where there is hatred let me bring your love<br>
Where there is injury, your pardon Lord<br>
And where there is doubt true faith in You<br>
<br>
Make me a channel of your peace<br>
Where there is despair in life let me bring hope<br>
Where there is darkness only light<br>
And where there's sadness ever joy<br>
<br>
Oh, Master grant that I may never seek<br>
So much to be consoled as to console<br>
To be understood as to understand<br>
To be loved as to love with all my soul<br>
<br>
Make me a channel of your peace<br>
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned<br>
It is in giving to all men that we receive<br>
And in dying that we are born to eternal life<br>
<br>
Oh, Master grant that I may never seek<br>
So much to be consoled as to console<br>
To be understood as to understand<br>
To be loved as to love with all my soul<br>
<br>
Make me a channel of your peace<br>
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope<br>
Where there is darkness only light<br>
And where there's sadness ever joy
