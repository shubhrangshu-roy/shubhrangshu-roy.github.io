<h1>The Great Dissolution</h1><br><br><h3>Be good, not pleasant, on the road ahead</h3><br><br><h5>2 October 2024</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>
<p>Today is Mahalaya, the great dissolution, an occassion to provide fuel to our departed ancestors, the journeymen, by way of oilseeds and water (til-sesame and Ganga jal) en route to eternity.
<p>That brings me to an interesting tale of the wayfarer, a long long time ago, that my father once told me when I was still in knickerbokers. Recently, I read that story in the Upanisad, addendum to the world's oldest recorded spiritual scriptures, the Veda. </p>
<p>Read on to learn more...</p>

<p>Once upon a time, a great sage-king Vajasrava decided to donate all his possessions to earn merit through the world conquering sacrifice, Visvajit.<br>
Seeing his father giving away his cattle, Nachiketa, the one who did not know, wondered, "What use these emaciated cows to those they are gifted, denied of water, deprived of grass, their udders dry, their strength spent?<br>
What joy do they bring?"<br>
And so, Nachiketa asked his father if he would gift him away as well. <br>
To whom? For profit? <br>
Irritated by such cheeky query in the middle of his great offerings, the king hit back: "Unto Death I gift you. Now"</p>

<p>Taking his father's cue for given, Nachiketa, gladly departed for Death's door, feeling blessed that he was the first of his group to follow the wayfarers into the unknown... happy to bring home the profits of sacrifice to his father, wondering how it must have been with the ancestors, and how must it be with those who follow, to go knocking at Death's gate.<br>
There, Nachiketa waited three nights before being allowed for a sit-in.<br>
Sorry to have kept the kid waiting unfed so long, Death, Yama, the great disciplinarian, offered Nachiketa three boons for choosing.<br>
"Ask, and you shall have them," he said. All!<br>
Come, choose.</p>

<p>"May Gautama, my tormented father, get calm, may he be gracious to me... O Death! May he recognise me and greet me back when you set me free.This I choose as my first gift," said Nachiketa.<br>
"Given. He, son of Arun, your father, will recognise you as before and sleep peacefully through the nights, his anger gone, when he sees you released from the jaws of Death," said Yama.</p>

<p>"There is no fear ... not even the fear of ageing... in heaven.<br>
One rejoices there, crossing over hunger and thirst, leaving sorrow behind.<br>
O Death, the pyre of sacrifice, the ship to heaven, tell me, then, how dwellers in heaven live on forever. <br>
Be honest.<br>
Let this be my second boon," said Nachiketa.</p>
