<h5>Demystifying The Elections</h5><br><h1>NaMo: The Second Coming</h1><br><h5>23 May 2019</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>
<p>Never mess with the ‘chowkidar’, for he can always return as ...</p>
<p>The Pied Piper of Hamelin</p>
 
<p>XII</p>
<p class="epic">Once more he stepped into the street<br>
And to his lips again <br>
Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane; <br>
And ere he blew three notes (such sweet <br>
Soft notes as yet musician’s cunning <br>
Never gave the enraptured air) <br>
There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling <br>
Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling, <br>
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, <br>
Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering, <br>
And, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering, <br>
Out came the children running. <br>
All the little boys and girls, <br>
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,<br> 
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls, <br>
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after <br>
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.</p>
<p>XIII</p>
<p class="epic">The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood <br>
As if they were changed into blocks of wood, <br>
Unable to move a step or cry, <br>
To the children merrily skipping by – <br>
And could only follow with the eye <br>
That joyous crowd at the Piper’s back. <br>
But how the Mayor was on the rack 
And the wretched Council’s bosoms beat,<br> 
As the Piper turned from the High Street <br>
To where the Weser rolled its waters <br>
Right in the way of their sons and daughters! <br>
However he turned from South to West <br>
And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed, <br>
And after him the children pressed;<br> 
Great was the joy in every breast. <br>
He never can cross that mighty top! <br>
He’s forced to let the piping drop <br>
And we shall see our children stop! <br>
When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side, <br>
A wondrous portal opened wide, <br>
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed; <br>
And the Piper advanced and the children followed, <br>
And when all were in to the very last, <br>
The door in the mountain-side shut fast. <br>
Did I say all? No! One was lame, <br>
And could not dance the whole of the way; <br>
And in after years, if you would blame <br>
His sadness, he was used to say,-- <br>
‘It's dull in our town since my playmates left! <br>
I can’t forget that I’m bereft <br>
Of all the pleasant sights they see, <br>
Which the Piper also promised me. <br>
For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,<br> 
Joining the town and just at hand,<br> 
Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, <br>
And flowers put forth a fairer hue, <br>
And everything was strange and new; <br>
The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here, <br>
And their dogs outran our fallow deer, <br>
And honey-bees had lost their stings, <br>
And horses were born with eagles’ wings: <br>
And just as I became assured <br>
My lame foot would be speedily cured, <br>
The music stopped and I stood still, <br>
And found myself outside the hill, <br>
Left alone against my will, <br>
To go now limping as before, <br>
And never hear of that country more!</p>
