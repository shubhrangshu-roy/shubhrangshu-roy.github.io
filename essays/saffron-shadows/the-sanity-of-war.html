<h1>The Sanity of War</h1><br><br><h5>15 May 2025</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>As INDIA's never-ending war of attrition with Pakistan pauses for the next phase of bombardment, here's sharing a few gems on the doctrine of war from Sri Ram's 'Operation Sindoor' against his neighbour Ravan from the mist of time.</p>

<p>They are an important learning, in this Age of Ram's resurrection in the magnificent temple at Ayodhya, and the massive reinterpretative undertaking of Ram Rajya in India.</p>

<p>As with Ram and Ravan then, the clash of Modi and Muneer, this time round, has turned out to be a fantastic War of Missiles. And so, the lessons from Lanka remain relevant for all times to come, no matter how hard a battle is fought, and no matter what the compulsions. For, Lanka, like no other tale of winner and loser,  points to a decisive outcome. This is something that the abrupt ceasefire has failed to deliver, as in the many rounds of our recent vitriolic past.</p>

<p>The Ramayan informs us that all advanced technological and psychological innovations in battle, then as now, must come with a set of preconditions and riders for an outcome to materialise.</p>

<p>For the record, the Ramayan of Valmiki (scripted 500 BCE) introduces us to Ravan as a brave, valorous and versatile warrior, with a rich history of conquests against the mightiest of gods; and as an erudite, but power-intoxicated king, riding the promise of invincibility. He takes on Ram, a 20-something prince-in-exile, and desperado, who is yet to cut his teeth on the battlefield.</p>

<p>We all know who won.</p>

<p>Then, why this setback?</p>

<p>Ravan, his huge army, and his technological prowess notwithstanding, is forced to bite the dust, because he dismisses the words of caution, and mounts his ego to ride into battle.</p>

<p>This, when, his grandfather,  Malyavan, old and wise, whispers into his ears, “A king who is learned in statecraft can rule for years and keep his enemies at bay. <br>
He declares war or peace according to the circumstances and through that he increases his own power.<br>
A king should wage war only against those who are weaker. He should make alliances with his equals and with those who are superior to him. An enemy should never be underestimated.<br>
"Ravan, I think we should make peace with Ram. You are obsessed. You should not oppose someone who has the gods rooting for his victory.”</p>

<p>When the mighty rakshas warriors grab their weapons, ready for battle, Ravan's woke brother Vibhishan makes a fervent plea, asking the warriors to wait. Placing his palms together he prays, “Force will only succeed if it is used correctly after proper deliberation, according to the rules...<br>
...or if the enemy is destined to die...<br>
or if he is engaged with other enemies...<br>
or if he is unaware.<br>
How can you think of attacking someone who is vigilant, who is supported by a huge army, who is determined to win, who has conquered his temper, and is invincible?"</p>

<p>Vibhishan goes on to suggest that finding companions who will tell you what you want to hear is easy. It is hard to find those who will speak the unpleasant truth. It is still harder to find those who will listen to it.</p>

<p>Yet, arrogance and timidity get a firm grip on Ravan, at a time when humility and temerity should have mattered to him the most.</p>

<p>On receiving inputs on enemy positions from his spies, the lord and master of his realm turns furious. He warns his messengers that the doctrine of war demands an economy of truth. "To keep the leader motivated."</p>

<p>It will take us a while to figure out the victor and the vanquished in the latest round of bluster between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, that the world has dismissed as a "skirmish". But in the next episode of this neverending war of good versus evil, the one who heeds the sanity of war will emerge as the real winner.</p>
