<h1>The Vitruvian Man: Maryada Purushottam</h1><br><h5>21 January 2024</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>
<p>Long before the first Ramayana epic was committed to palm leaf at least two thousand five hundred years ago, if not much earlier, its author Valmiki, asked the scholar Narada: “Is there a man in the world today who is truly virtuous? Who is there who is mighty and yet knows both what is right and how to act upon it? Who always speaks the truth and holds firmly to his vows? Who exemplifies proper conduct and is benevolent to all creatures? Who is learned, capable, and a pleasure to behold? Who is self-controlled, having subdued his anger? Who is both judicious and free from envy? Who, when his fury is aroused in battle, is feared even by the gods?”
</p>

<p>Narada replied: “Listen. The many virtues you have listed are hard to find. Let me think a moment before I speak…</p>

<p>Hear now…, the man who has it all, is Ram. All men know of him. Born in the Iksvaku clan, he is self-controlled, mighty, radiant, steadfast, and masterful. He is wise. He bears good conduct. He is eloquent. He is majestic.</p>

<p>His shoulders are broad, his arms mighty and reach down to his knees, his limbs symmetrical, his chest vast, his collarbone set deep in muscle, his chest muscular, his neck like a conch shell, his jaws powerful, his brow noble, his eyes large, his face well-chiselled, his gait graceful, his proportions are perfect.</p>

<p>He is tall, dark and handsome.</p>

<p>Splendid! Auspicious.</p>

<p>Contemplative!</p>

<p>He is renowned. He is learned. He is pure. He is disciplined.</p>

<p>He is righteous and forever true to word.</p>

<p>His top priority is the welfare of citizens.</p>

<p>He protects all that lives. He is the guardian of public morality.</p>

<p>People love him because he is good, cheerful and smart.</p>

<p>He is a good companion to good companions, as the ocean is to rivers.</p>

<p>He is as deep as the ocean, as unyielding as the Himalaya.</p>

<p>He is noble and fair in every frame of reference.</p>

<p>He is a pleasure to behold!</p>

<p>He is as mighty as Vishnu, as pleasant as the moon.</p>

<p>He is philanthropic as Kubera, the richest divine; truthful as Dharma, the most learned of gods.</p>

<p>He is very intelligent.</p>

<p>He is learned in traditional scriptures.</p>

<p>He has a major in the essence of wholesome knowledge, the Veda, with minor in its supplementary sciences.</p>

<p>He is an expert in the science of warfare, and well-equipped in the art of wielding weapons.</p>

<p>He wields a huge bow to annihilate his enemies.</p>

<p>When angry, he rages like fire at the end of time, yet rivals the earth in patience.</p>

<p>He is …</p>

<p>Son of Kausalya. Brother of Laksman. Husband of Sita.</p>

<p>He was exiled by Dasaratha his father, who wanted him to be king.</p>

<i><p>yavat sthasyanti girayah saritas ca mahitale
tavad ramayanakatha lokesu pracarisyati</p>

<p>as long as the mountains and rivers shall endure upon the earth,
so long will the tale of ramayana be told among the people.</p></i>
