            <h1>The King’s Ring</h1><br><h5>13 April 2020</h5><br><h5>Theodore Tilton</h5><br>
            
<p>I.</p>
<p class="epic">Once in Persia reigned a King,<br>
Who upon his signet ring<br>
Graved a maxim true and wise,<br>
Which, if held before his eyes,<br>
Gave him counsel, at a glance,<br>
Fit for every change or chance:<br>
Solemn words, and these are they:<br>
‘Even this shall pass away!’</p><br>

<p>II.</p>
<p class="epic">Trains of camels through the sand<br>
Brought him gems from Samarcand;<br>
Fleets of galleys through the seas<br>
Brought him pearls to rival these.<br>
But he counted little gain<br>
Treasures of the mine or main.<br>
What is wealth? the King would say;<br>
‘Even this shall pass away.’</p><br>

<p>III.</p>
<p class="epic">In the revels of his court,<br>
At the zenith of the sport,<br>
When the palms of all his guests<br>
Burned with clapping at his jests,<br>
He, amid his figs and wine,<br>
Cried, O loving friends of mine!<br>
Pleasure comes, but not to stay:<br>
‘Even this shall pass away.’</p><br>

<p>IV.</p>
<p class="epic">Lady fairest ever seen<br>
Was the bride he crowned his queen.<br>
Pillowed on the marriage-bed,<br>
Whispering to his soul, he said,<br>
Though a bridegroom never pressed<br>
Dearer bosom to his breast,<br>
Mortal flesh must come to clay:<br>
‘Even this shall pass away.’</p><br>

<p>V.</p>
<p class="epic">Fighting on a furious field,<br>
Once a javelin pierced his shield.<br>
Soldiers with a loud lament<br>
Bore him bleeding to his tent.<br>
Groaning from his tortured side,<br>
Pain is hard to bear, he cried,<br>
But with patience day by day,<br>
‘Even this shall pass away.’</p><br>

<p>VI.</p>
<p class="epic">Towering in the public square<br>
Twenty cubits in the air,<br>
Rose his statue carved in stone.<br>
Then the King, disguised, unknown,<br>
Gazing at his sculptured name,<br>
Asked himself, And what is fame?<br>
Fame is but a slow decay:<br>
‘Even this shall pass away.’</p><br>

<p>VII.</p>
<p class="epic">Struck with palsy, sere and old,<br>
Waiting at the Gates of Gold,<br>
Spake he with his dying breath,<br>
Life is done, but what is Death?<br>
Then, in answer to the King,<br>
Fell a sunbeam on his ring,<br>
Showing by a heavenly ray --<br>
Even this shall pass away.</p>
