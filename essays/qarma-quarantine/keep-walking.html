<h1>Keep Walking</h1><br><h5>28 March 2020</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>
            
<p class="epic">Hey! That's Me... I am Adam!<br>
Eversince I climbed down the Tree of Knowledge, I have been walking. <br>
First, I walked into the cave, thinking that was a safe place to be.<br>
But then, I heard the Voice. And it was the Voice of Eve.<br>
She commanded: Go, get me my daily flesh. Keep walking!<br>
And I walked...<br>
And then, I heard the voice of Eve once more. <br>
And, she demanded: Now, get me my daily bread. Keep walking.<br>
And I walked and walked and walked.<br>
And I walked Out of Eden!<br>
Just in case you don’t remember in quarantine, there’s this other Adam out there right now, Walking  Out of Eden! <br>
You might have heard of him,  Paul Salopek, walking across Manipur at this moment, and all the way towards China. God Bless Him!<br></p>
            
<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/out-of-eden-walk/"><b>You can read more of him in here.</b></a></p>

<p class="epic">But then, Paul’s just another diversion.<br>
Let me get back to Adam...<br> 
That’s me!<br>
So, where was I?<br>
Hmm! Out of Eden, I suppose.<br>
And so, I kept walking.<br>
Walking all over the place. <br>
From one home to another... <br>
Finding one home after another.<br> 
Erecting one home after another.<br>
Till I heard that voice from the cave again and again and again: Keep Walking!<br>
And so, I have been searching for a new home every day. Since I left home through my daddy’s dark tunnel and into my mama’s dark cave.  <br>
Once upon a time!<br>
O Holy Father! O Divine Mother!<br>
You made me walk!<br>
And so, I walk every year.<br>
And I walk great distances.<br> 
Around the Ka’ba...<br>
    And into St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican.</p>
<p class="epic">And once every year I also take a long walk to the Holy River Ganga and back home across hundreds of miles carrying the sacred in a pot to my near and dear ones: <br>
To Mama... To Papa...To Eve... To Cain... and To Abel<br>
You would have noticed me on the highway and in your city ... and cursed me, perhaps... calling me the mad kawariya  on a drive, oops! walk, encroaching traffic.<br>
Once in 12 years, I also walk great distances, from the Himalayas, and from the Oceans to the Kumbh... in search of the elusive Elixir of Life! <br>
Once in a lifetime, I also walk around the sacred, high up there in the clouds ... circumbulating Mt. Kailash.</p>
<p class="epic">You know what...<br>
I have walked right across...<br>
The Sahara...<br>
The Amazon...<br>
The Antarctica...<br>
And all the way..<br>
To North Pole <br>
To Mt. Everest.<br>
Why,  I have also walked on The Moon!<br>
Remember, that ONE SMALL STEP OF MAN...?<br>
As I said at the start, I HAVE BEEN WALKING for a long time now... ever since I climbed down the Tree of Knowledge in Eden.<br>
That story’s been etched on my DNA a long time ago. <br>
Keep Walking!<br>
And that alone is FAITH!<br>
And now, stupid man! <br>
Ever since you have locked yourself in, you have been crying yourself hoarse... <br>
Aloud!: There walks Adam, hundreds of miles to his home.<br>
And you want an aeroplane to fly me down to nowhere!<br>
Thank You, But No Thank You!<br>
I could do without the sympathy of your intoxicated mind. <br>
Your spirit is harsh on my soul.<br>
I walk in the company of pride, not pity.<br>
Just take a good look at my first of the pictures on the highway ...<br>
There walks Eve. <br>
And behind her, walk proudly Baby and Me.<br>
And as we walk the distance back to where we belong. ... <br>
in graceful, dignified, silent steps...  <br>
I plead with you to stop ranting on Facebook, <br>
telling the government what it must do.<br>
It’s doing all it can with all it has...<br> 
For us 1.3 billion Indians...</p>
