<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / None of My Business</h5><br><h1>Mind it, I love driving</h1><br><h5>2003-2006</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>These jholawallahs must be crazy. Petitioning the government every
now and then against raising petroleum prices despite international
crude oil prices going through the roof. Ugh! when will the gods drive
sense into these commies, I wonder. Come to think of it, for the best
part of my working life, I was bussing it to office. Petrol prices were dirt
cheap then at less than twenty bucks to a litre, but I could ill afford the
luxury of driving to work. Why, I could ill afford a two-wheeler, leave
alone a car. Then, the prices began to spiral. But even before it
breached the Rs 30 mark in mid-2002 after the administered prices
regime was dismantled, I was already driving a 4WD to office and back,
averaging a good 100 km a day.</p>
<p>And now that it’s gone up further, crossing Rs 40 to a litre, I am actually
doing it twice over. Between us, a working couple at home, we drive
two cars to office, doing a minimum 200 km a day out of a common
family kitty. There are others too. Suburban DINK families driving into
the city. On their own. For comfort and for space. And for work-hour
convenience. Somehow, petrol prices don’t seem to matter. And the
carpool never works.</p>

<p>Why, come to think of it, between June 2002, and now, when petrol
prices in Delhi went up from Rs 29.94 to Rs 40.49, car sales across the
country went up from 509,088 to 819,918. In fact, back in 1997, when I
first bought a car, only 388,015 cars sold all over the country.
Obviously, many families, like mine, are driving two or more cars to
work and leisure. In fact, why just cars, two-wheeler sales too have
gone up by huge numbers. Which is why you no longer have the rookie
bussing it to office because his wages are no longer pitifully low. There
are so many more people driving cars and bikes and scooters and they
no longer need a bus. And carpools still don’t work.</p>

<p>Have you ever asked yourself why this is so, even as you ruminate over
rising petrol prices? Or have you asked why has electricity consumption
gone up; why are many more people using LPG stoves to cook, why
are so many more people flying in and out of cities? Why petrol
consumption in the country has gone up by 1.7 million tonnes in the
past five years; why the sale of petroleum products has gone up from
100 million tonnes to 112 million tonnes?</p>

<p>I am no economist to explain this funda. But I can bank on common
sense. One simple reason why we are making do with more two-
wheelers and cars despite rising oil prices is that we are earning so
much more and so much more willing to spend. Because that’s exactly
what makes life that much easier for us. Now come to look at it this
way, India’s average per capita income grew from Rs 17,823 in June of
2002 to Rs 20,989 around the summer of last year. And most of us, car
users, ended up taking much more money home than every other Tom,
Dick and Harry, to spend on what our previous generation considered
unwanted luxuries of life. But with rising incomes, that attitude has
changed. And with changing attitudes, we are capable of earning that
much more. So, despite prices going up that much higher, our ability to
spend has begun to rise as well.</p>

<p>There’s a simple pointer to this: while our per capita earnings grew a
good 18% between the summer of 2002 and 2004, prices, measured by
the whole sale price index rose 11.43% in this period, sparing us so
much more cash. Never mind the rising petrol prices, that while having
gone up 19.27% over the past two summer, still accounted for a
modest 7% of the rising prices.</p>

<p>So, what’s making this happen? Why didn’t our fathers live in such
interesting times? I can sense one reason for that. Our fathers grew up
in a marketplace that was driven by agricultural and manufacturing
incomes. And in that society of yesterday, the labour of human body
determined how much one could earn. We live in a knowledge society
now. And knowledge incomes are driving the way we live. So, our
productivity is no longer a hostage to our muscles; instead, it’s driven
by the power of our individual and collective minds. And when you get
your minds to work, there’s hardly a limit to returns. Because you are
investing your knowledge capital that can only grow over time.</p>

<p>Now knowledge equity has this one thing about it, it’s not trapped in the
cyclical vagaries of time. Which is why, you are more secure about your
future. And you are willing to spend that much more, knowing fully well
that you can beat rising prices or petrol or whatever, by the power of
your mind. So, you don’t mortgage your today in the fear of tomorrow.
Go, take a long drive out on the highway or wherever. And raise a toast
to liberalisation, to the knowledge era. It doesn’t really matter if the
prices go up again. Go, drive!</p>
