<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / None of My Business</h5><br><h1>Smile an everlasting smile</h1><br><h5>February 2006</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>He looked at me and smiled,” the Baby of Boribunder flitted across the
corridor spreading sunshine on a damp winter morning even as folks
were just about getting busy at work.
“Yes, he looked at me too and smiled,” shot back the elderly matron,
smiling. In a flash, there were smiles all over the mile-long hallway, and
across the other end of the building, right into The Times Of India
boardroom in Mumbai. Baby, Baba, Babe, Babu, Bunty and Bubli. Just
about everybody, from the lowly peon to the second most important
person in the country, was smiling. No wonder, they say, a smile is the
shortest distance between two people. Cliched! you would say. So,
what? I ask.</p>

<p>Believe me, I had never seen a sea of smiles like I did last
Friday, when King Khan came calling at the Times newsroom to edit its
Saturday edition. The nearest I had seen till then was a collective
expression of awe when Bill Clinton came calling the first time round to
India. And although I have never come face to face with Bachchan Sr,
I’d imagine, he is a personality that would also generate collective awe.
You have seen the TOI edition by now, so I won’t sit on judgement over
its content. But you can certainly take this from me, of all the human
emotions that I have ever invited myself to, I’d give my soul any day for
a smile. Which brings me to that question: When was it that I smiled
last? Of course, when Shah Rukh dropped in at The Times, I, a
privileged outsider from the other end of the world, smiled in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>What makes?</p>

<p>I can’t really bring myself to imagine what makes another person smile
at you, which is really so rare. But when I come to think of it, in a world full of misery, a smile certainly is the shortest tread to happiness, which is
possibly why Mona Lisa’s smile is considered the greatest work of art
ever, bested only by the Smiley.</p>

<p>Ancient Indian wisdom categorises human emotions into nine distinct
expressions or navrasas — shringar, veer, raudra, advut, karuna,
hasya, bhayanak, shant, vibhatsa. It also adds two other forms —
vatsalya and bhakti. I am not qualified linguist, so I won’t venture to
provide you with an English translation of each of those words; I guess
you’ll appreciate them anyway. The nearest expression to a smile
among those 9+2 is, possibly, hasya, which should, otherwise, qualify
as humour. But humour, at times, can come from the gallows. So, I
wonder why the ancient masters did not incorporate the smile above
every other engagement of the human face.</p>

<p>I guess, the answer to that lies in the progress of human civilisation that
has been built on conquest, in reaching beyond the boundaries, to
claim what’s yours as mine, as a matter of right. It’s also come from the
human desire to explore beyond the known ever since the caveman
ventured out of the secluded confines of his cave. No wonder, they say,
who dares wins.</p>

<p>And yet, does the winner take all? Certainly not, I guess. Because, in
daring, we often give expression to the most fearsome emotions, when
a simple smile would do. History is witness to man’s greatest defeat in
the conquest of others. This is the reason why in winning the Kalinga
war, Emperor Ashoka, tasted his most inglorious defeat. Because, you
can vanquish a people by the sternest expression of your soul, but you
just cannot get connected by flexing your muscles. So, it’s time you
pondered why it takes 37 muscles to frown, but only four to smile. The
answer’s in my best songlines from BeeGees:</p>
<p class="epic">Smile an everlasting smile<br>
A smile can bring you near to me<br>
Don't ever let me find you down<br>
Cause that would bring a tear to me<br>
This world has lost its glory<br>
Let's start a brand new story now...</p>

<p>And those songlines reverberated in my ears last week, as I watched
King Khan brush past the Times corridor into an ocean of stares and
glances. And the babies of Boribunder glided down the aisle raining
sunshine with effervescent smileys pasted on their faces.</p>

<p>But, how’s it that in a world populated by billions of people, it’s not very
often that we come across someone who can make us smile and get
connected? It’s possible because, unlike Shah Rukh Khan and his
movies, the world, after all, is not such a beautiful place. It’s possibly
because conformity with the given though desirable is not quite an
achievable task. It’s possibly because the drudgery of daily existence
doesn’t leave us at peace with our inner selves. It’s possible because in
chasing the material advances of our civilisation, we have lost touch
with our innocence somewhere.</p>

<p>And into that dreadful world of human enrichment, enter Shah Rukh
Khan in his larger-than-life multiplex presence, tells us all’s well in his
make-believe tinsel world of happiness and peace.</p>
<p>Go, smile, anyway. :)</p>
