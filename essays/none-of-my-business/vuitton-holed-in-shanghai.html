<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / None of My Business</h5><br><h1>Vuitton-holed in Shanghai</h1><br><h5></h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>How do you sell luxury to poor, impoverished people,” I asked my
host and chairman of the world’s biggest luxury brand Louis Vuitton,
Yves Carcelle, over drinks at the upscale FACE bar at Ruijin Guest
House in Shanghai. It was the night before LV’s launch of its mega
store at Plaza 66 across the hotel where we had put up.</p>

<p>I had landed in Shanghai barely 24 hours ago and was taken up by the
glitz of urban China that reflected on its countless aluminium, glass and
concrete structures. Its broad streets and elevated carriageways. Under
neon lights across the city. Earlier, Rebecca, Yves’ better half, had
raved over dinner at Ye Shanghai in XinTianDi, a hip and happening
district, about how the face of the city had changed since she first set foot here in 1991. “You still had the rickshaws. And a million bicycles all over the city. That was Shanghai then. Today, all that is gone. Shanghai
belongs to a different civilisation.”</p>

<p>I soaked in a slice of this new, prosperous civilisation on the night of
LV’s big launch party, jiving in the company of 2,000 of the city’s elite
where a thousand and five hundred bottles of Moet &amp; Chandon were
uncorked in the dazzle of glittering lights, to the beats from all-time
favourite Beatles to the more in-tune Punjabi MC. But that was a gift-
wrapped surprise that had to wait till tomorrow.
Today, my mind was still wrapped up in the dirty and unwashed linen of
third-world India, agonising over the ‘human face of reforms’ that our
prime minister had made famous on taking office this summer. “How do
you sell a $400 wallet to a person whose average daily earning is as
low as $1.60,” I asked. Earlier this year, Louis Vitton opened its
store in Delhi at the Oberoi, and a big splash has been planned for the
November launch of its Mumbai store at the Taj Mahal, where a thousand
more champagne bottles are waiting to be uncorked. The Shanghai
glitter stood in the distance.</p>
<p>“You don’t sell luxury,” Yves responded. “People chase luxury products
across the world because they excite their emotional needs. The way
you decide to have it. The packaging. The selling ceremony. Luxury
products are something that makes your heartbeat quicker. They make
your dreams come true.”</p>

<p>For Indians chasing a dream at the end of a rainbow, the $3 billion
luxury brand of Vitton has been the ultimate luxury statement for well
over 100 years since the days of the maharajas. But for a country fed
on socialist diet for 50 years now, still debating what it takes to lift a
a quarter of its people over the poverty line, the LV sign should be as
distant as the rainbow, which is perhaps why you don’t see its
signboard on the high street, but in the confines of luxury hotels, where
people as rich as the wine-loving, Havana-smoking media baron Aveek
Sarkar and film star Ameesha Patel and Mumbai tycoon Adi Godrej
can better appreciate the meaning of high life.</p>
<p>Or is it true that luxury is only for a handful?</p>

<p>“Not quite,” announced the International Herald Tribune on Thursday,
running a four-column back page anchor: “India’s rich buy into a lifestyle,”
quoting a world wealth report from Merrill Lynch that India has 61,000
millionaires, in US dollar terms. That’s quite a number. Small wonder
then, Yves told me on the eve of the Shanghai bash that the sense of
luxury had been always there in India though limited in its reach. Now
it’s time for a big time celebration. A generation ago, Indians went to the
West and settled down there, soaking themselves in the luxuries that
the prosperous markets had to offer. The new generation that’s going
out, is coming back home as young entrepreneurs. They are into
software, textiles, pharma and research, building the future
India. Bringing back with them the good things of life to a confident and
prospering India. This is why LV set shop at the Oberoi and the Taj.
Yet, look at it deeper. LV could be getting its numbers by offering luxury to those who can pay for it. What does it get for the average Indian? And
before you have the likes of communist mascot Sitaram Yechuri
screaming invasion from the rooftops, go, get out and take a view of
Shanghai where Mao jackets have given way to Armani and Hugo
Boss.</p>

<p>It takes a dream for a person to move ahead. And reinvent a civilisation
to march with modern times. There are a hundred and one problems
that still confront China. But there are a thousand and one dreams that
are getting real every day. Because it’s brands such as Vuitton and
Armani and Chanel are driving ordinary people to aspire to the
good things in life. And in the process, creating a market for world-class
brands that, in turn, are pulling in bigger investments and helping more
people get better jobs. What else could be better than that?
It’s time to shed our socialist baggage in favour of the Louis Vuitton
handbag.</p>
