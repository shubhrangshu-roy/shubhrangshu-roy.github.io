<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / None of My Business</h5><br><h1>ET through Barbie’s tinted shades</h1><br><h5>2003-2006</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>Come summer, three bright uns will join us at Team ET from
Stephens. They must be crazy. What will three bright kids from Delhi’s
upper crust, who could have got the best deal in campus placements,
do with a pack of jokers? I’ll give you a hint of the best campus deal this
summer at Stephens. It’s gone for 650 grand. But our bright uns ain’t no
losers. They’ll make do with a starting pay cheque that bests KPMG
and E&amp; Y. Jokers us, nevertheless? Go, ask Bull. Bulls are a crazy sort.</p>

<p>He’s the guy who runs the show at Corporate Dossier, CD for short.
Before he stepped in here, he did a stint at advertising hotspot Lowe,
then Lintas. He kicked that job to be with us and get his one-on-one
with the likes of Jim Collins. Jim Who? I knew you’d ask that question.
You see, this crazy bunch at ET. They never talk to the likes of Tom
and Dick and Harry, unless, of course, Harry is the third in line to the
throne in London. Bull says he’s more comfortable with the likes of Jim
the management guru. Even Deepak Chopra will do. Aah Chopra, the
spiritual master!? That reminds me of Rebecca. She dined me to
greens at Ye Shanghai in, well, Shanghai’s upper-end Xintiandi last
September when I asked her if she’d become a vegan outta spiritual
compulsions. Rebecca revealed hers was a fad, before taking to the
dance floor. Now, I’m sure you’ve met Rebecca by now. She’s the
better half of the Carcelles who have been dropping in once-in-a-while
at Delhi and Mumbai; husband Yves makes do with running the show at
the world’s biggest luxury brand LV, makers of those super brand
handbags. Aah, all these people. Now, Baba says they are PLUs.
People Like Us, you know. Baba runs the show here in Delhi. I never
question him.</p>

<p>This journalism thing, you know. Our journos at ET have come a long
way, baby. It’s no longer the jholawallah types, you see, in Kolhapuri
chappals. Those middle-class sorts. It’s Marzotto in winter in the
newsroom. And Heidi Slimane linen in summer. Jija has even been
sporting a pair of espadrilles to the office that she picked up from Barney’s
in New York. Jija’s the one who runs the show on Sunday ET. But then,
journalism at ET’s always been like this. And so have ET journos. Like
the caviar garnish sprinkled on a tasty dish. Writing for People Like Us.
You can check that out with Resh at ET Travel. She’s been indulging
herself in caviar and Moet Chandon since God-knows-when, the way
the PLTs make do with chaai-paani. Can’t help it, ya know. After all,
ET’s not a run-of-the-mill broadsheet that hawkers go peddling at traffic
lights. You only get to see this Pink Edge thing in the hands of the back-
seat commuters in limos at traffic lights. Which is why it sells so less.
To just about 1.2 million readers. Which is less than one-tenth of a per
cent of the country’s population. Even our great-grandmother from
Boribunder, The Times of India, is read by ten times as many readers.
Poor us, guys at ET. Poor me! It’s just that I can’t complain any longer.
Life on the other side of Fleet Street has been stressful. Makes me feel
like those middle-class sorts on DTC buses or tin-box motorised
rickshaws. It’s been good money for a while here now. I’ve paid through
for a four-wheel drive once, then taken on a sedan to make it to the office
from my suburban pad. Yet, those fourth-floor types who sign our pay
cheques thought I hadn’t had enough. So, they threw in a canary yellow
car of choice for my weekend outings. Can’t help it, you see. But life’s
like that. And better take it as it comes. So what, even if the tax guys
have been taking a big pick out of my pocket, and now they have this
fringe whatever. But that’s a concession you make when you live life on
the high street. Writing for people like us. Writing on people like us.
Like Kumar Birla, for instance. We write for him. He too writes for us.
Just as he did when Bill Boy came to town the other day. Kumar drove
with Gates for a one-on-one on behalf of ET. Like the rest of the gang
does on Budget Day. Sunil Mittal, Mukesh Ambani, Anand Mahindra,
and the lot. We write on Budget for them. They write on Budget for us.
Like TK does on the edit page day after day. Telling the FM what he
must do for us. Telling us what we must do about the FM. He’s the kind
that makes for the intellectual upper crust who couldn’t care less about
life on the backstreet. Because ET’s not read on the backstreet. Or like
Swami does on Budget Day, flying down from D.C. Or as Ajay does
with his team at ETIG crunching numbers to make sense for those who
matter. Now Ajay’s the guy who dropped in at ET from IIM-Bangalore
so that he could tell the likes of him how to go about their business
better.</p>

<p>Life’s a Big Party at ET. We have no bread to offer. So, I make do
with the cake. We have the cake and eat it too. For life on our side of
the world is tinted. Sometimes in Pink. Most often in the colour of the
Dior sunglasses that Barbie wears to the office.</p>
