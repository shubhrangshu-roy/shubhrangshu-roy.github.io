<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / None of My Business</h5><br><h1>In Search Of Excellence</h1><br><h5></h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>Have you ever asked yourself this question: How does a telephone
instrument vendor goes on to become the country’s biggest mobile phone
operator? Or for that matter, how does a bicycle maker in a small town
Ludhiana become the world’s biggest two-wheeler manufacturer; an
airport trolley operator in Hong Kong, India’s biggest private airline
operator; the son of a Kolkata scrap merchant the world’s biggest steel
manufacturer?</p>
<p>Come, think again.</p>

<p>We are not talking about impossible dreams. The one common thread that
runs across this year’s winners of The Economic Times Awards for
Corporate Excellence — Sunil Bharti Mittal (Business leader of the
year), Brijmohan Lall Munjal (Lifetime achievement), Naresh Goyal
(The emerging company of the year) and Lakshmi Niwas Mittal (Global
Indian of the year) — is their quest for individual and organisational
excellence. For, dreams get real when, and only when, the dreamer
excels in his calling.</p>
<p>What makes them?</p>
<p>For all the management lessons on how to make it big, the answer’s
simple. For, as Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, the planet’s third richest
man, said the other day, at the ET Awards in Mumbai: “To dream and
reach for the sky is good, but at the same time it is equally important to
keep your feet on the ground.” That’s Lesson 1 for those in search of
Excellence.</p>

<p>Management gurus Thomas J Peters and Robert H Waterman, Jr,
pointed to simple facts of life that made for Corporate Excellence in
their best-selling book of two decades ago: In Search of Excellence —
Lessons from America’s Best-Run Companies. “One of the main clues
to corporate excellence has come to be incidents of unusual effort on
the part of apparently ordinary employees. Excellence also comes from
a sustained exceptional financial performance,” they said.
Now, just look around your immediate corporate environment. Not too
many examples abound. Why? Years of licensing restrictions, capacity
constraints, bureaucratic red tape, high incidents of taxation and
lobbying in New Delhi’s corridors of power sapped the energies of
India’s biggest business moghuls from reaching global heights. Result:
They were into too many small businesses at the same time, without
making it good in any. Unfortunately, 15 years after reforms, most of
them are yet to come out of that stupor. Those who did, like Messrs
Brijmohan Munjal, Sunil Mittal and Naresh Goyal soared to kiss the
sky. As for Lakshmi Mittal, it took him to explore foreign shores to make
it big in the global arena because, for three decades, his native land had
no opportunity to offer.</p>

<p>Let’s take the Munjals. For four unending decades, the Hero group
patriarch had to hammer his way up to emerge as the world’s biggest
bicycle maker in a country where pedal pushing for long was the
common man’s mode of transport. And yet, he figured nowhere in the
top echelons of corporate India. That was well in the 80s when licence-
permit raj ruled. But once the restrictions were gone, it took him only 10
years to emerge as the world’s biggest two-wheeler manufacturer,
beating partner Honda in the race for global market share.</p>
<p>The Munjals didn’t need to bank on management superstars to emerge
world beaters. At best, they needed a global mind to put to test. And
they made do with ordinary folks in the ordinary town of Ludhiana to beat
the best in global business because of their passion for making it big.
And that passion blossomed once the curbs were gone. Ditto with Sunil
Mittal and Naresh Goyal. Neither of them needed the best B-School
tags to come on top. They remained on the fringes as long as the
government wouldn’t let go. But once private initiatives were allowed in
the telecom and civil aviation sectors, they let their ambitions soar. And
there was no looking back to their past.</p>

<p>They also kept their balance sheets clean and healthy, never raiding
company profits for personal enrichment. No asset stripping. No cash
transfers into personal accounts. Personal enrichment logically followed
the strength of their bottom-line performances.</p>

<p>Peters and Waterman say excellent companies also nourish individuals
who believe so strongly in their ideas that they take it upon themselves to
damn the bureaucracy and manoeuvre their projects through the
system and out to the customer. In doing so, quality and service
become the hallmarks of excellence. They all tap into the deepest needs of hundreds of thousands of people waiting for their products. Brijmohan
Munjal and Lakhsmi Mittal wove amazing success stories around
themselves, even as lesser mortals failed, by reaching the right product
to the customer at the right point in time. But that’s not all.
As Times Group managing director Vineet Jain pointed out in his
address at the ET Awards, Mr Munjal’s excellence should not be judged
by his being the largest bicycles and motorcycles maker in the world,
nor Mr Lakshmi Mittal’s in being the world’s largest steel maker. Those
two eminences, in their ways, demonstrated to the world how
excellence could be achieved by transcending the restrictive
the stranglehold of belief, dogma and narrowness by freeing the mind from the prisonhouse of national and regional boundaries. They freed their minds from credal adherence to what had been bequeathed to them
from the past.</p>

<p>Both Mr Munjal and Mr Mittal came from families that had been severed
from their roots by the Partition. And yet, both transcended the
geographical boundaries of their birth by emerging global winners.
How did they do this?
They did this by freeing their minds from the Given. Nobody had to tell
Mr Munjal, that dominance for him did not have to remain confined to
being the world’s largest bicycle maker. It was he and only he who
needed to transcend the barriers of the mind to emerge as the world’s
biggest two-wheeler manufacturer as well.</p>

<p>Likewise, some 30 years ago, when Mr Mittal left home for Indonesia to
acquire a small foundry in that country, he not only transcended the
geographical barriers of his nation, but even transcended the barriers of
race, creed, caste and comfort to look at the entire world as his oyster,
building the foundations of his transcontinental steel empire.
Down the ages, men and women who have had the vision to look
beyond the obvious, are the ones who have always stood up and been
counted. Because, excellence, to them, became another word for
knowledge.</p>
<p>So, what’s knowledge?</p>
<p>Knowledge is not the ability to distinguish between fact and fiction.
Knowledge is the vision to anticipate tomorrow. Knowledge is
an insight into the unknown.</p>

<p>Winners see knowledge, not as progress from untruth to truth. They
see knowledge as scaling up from a lower truth to a higher truth. By
perceiving knowledge on that plane, they no longer frown upon
yesterday with disgust or disdain. All that they do instead, is see
knowledge as a staircase with various landings. And they can
ascend and descend those landings according to the circumstances of their being is what makes them excel.</p>

<p>This is why, as Mr Jain pointed out, it is no longer important that Mr
Sunil Mittal, was the biggest vendor of telephone instruments
yesterday. Or that he is the country’s biggest mobile phone operator
today. For all we know, he may eventually quit the mobile phone
business tomorrow, having already sold 10 per cent of his stake to
Vodafone, and emerge as the country’s biggest vegetable exporter in
the days to come — he has already tied up with the Rothschilds to
export fresh vegetables to Europe. What Mr Mittal did yesterday, or
what he does today, or even what he may be doing tomorrow, is not
excellence. Excellence, for Mr Mittal, is his ability to transcend the
various landings on the staircase of his life at will on the power of prior
knowledge.</p>
