<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / In Good Company</h5><br><h1>Life begins at 40</h1><br><h5>2000-2006</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>It’s a dead end, boss. You are awaiting a holocaust,” I drew Subroto
Bagchi’s attention to the impending crisis that awaits Bangalore’s tech
community. India’s, I should say. Now Subroto Bagchi’s one of those
brilliant minds who wandered into the world of information technology
by design, rather than accident, after majoring in, of all things, political
science, to eventually set up MindTree Consulting, Bangalore’s hottest
IT services outfit.</p>

<p>There are nearly half-a-million nerds in the IT services sector in India,
some 140,000 of them working out of Bangalore. MindTree employs
1,700 of them. The average age of these techies is 30 years. A bulk of
them are code writers who join cushy jobs soon after graduating from
reputed technology schools, several of them from the IITs. By the time
they are 30, many of them manage complex assignments, executing
software tasks worth millions of dollars for high profile Silicon Valley
firms.</p>

<p>By 2008, India’s IT services sector is expected to employ 3.3 million
code writers, 60% of whom, or 2 million, would be employed by Indian
outfits and the rest, by the in-house centres of the global IT majors.
Now, of the 2 million that will get sucked in by the Indian outfits, 1.4
million would be employed by the top four players alone, TCS, Infosys,
Wipro and Satyam. That’s as big as the whole of Indian Army. Just
think of it, India’s going to be home to a huge army of code warriors
barely four years from now. And we are just getting started.
“That’s when your problems will start,” I told Subroto Bagchi. “What will
happen to your 30-year-olds then? What will happen when today’s hip
techie turns 40? Will he still be writing those codes?”</p>

<p>There couldn’t have been a better person than me to ask the question,
having crossed over to the wrong side of 40 and grappling with mid-life
crisis. More than half my buddies who started together have wandered
out of the profession, yielding place to a bunch Johnnies-come-lately
who are brilliant at their jobs. How often I have wondered what I am
doing out here. But then, journalism’s always been a happening place,
and so far, I have managed to tuck myself in a comfortable corner.
Also, journalism’s never going to get as huge as the software sector.
So, do I really have a problem?</p>

<p>“Life begins at 40,” Subroto Bagchi said, getting me startled. But then,
he added with a somewhat grim refrain: “It’s true that very few
companies have thought through the 40s conundrum. If you don’t
address this issue now, you’ll have a huge problem. Of course, one of
the best things about IT is it was born as a global industry and
constantly mutated. The other interesting thing is we don’t fix things
until they are broke.” That’s called jugad in north India where I come
from. It’s going to be exciting to watch, I bet.</p>

<p>Subroto Bagchi says he’s looked ahead in time though. Today’s 30-
year-old code writer will have to make himself capable of multi-tasking if
he still wants to keep running at 40. Broadly speaking, he will have to
learn to be extremely good at least at two of several things that will
define his future assignments: he will manage resources, he will
manage technology, and he will manage complexity. “And he will have
to be different from what made him good at 30,” Surboto Bagchi said.
Managing resources means that he will have to learn to manage people
and manage capital budgets to achieve operational efficiency.</p>

<p>Managing technology means that he will initially have to become a
knowledge and technology master, but at 40 he will have to know the
economics of technology. This is to say, he better know the economic
implications of Java, he better know its social cost. Bigger than these,
perhaps, will be the ability of today’s 30-year-olds to learn to manage
complexities. It’s like when you find out that your biggest customer
wants to elope with your biggest competitor. What do you do then?
Because there’s no precedence to follow. At 40, the guys who just
know technology but are awed by the complexities of the workplace will
be dead. The guys who learn to master this art will be the chosen
leaders. The others will have to just make do.</p>

<p>Looking back at myself, I don’t seem to have too much of a choice.
“Too old to rock m roll, too young to die,” I murmured to myself. That
was Subroto Bagchi sprang his biggest hope for me. The guy at the
wrong side of 40 could also master the art of rainmaking, he said.
“What’s that,” I asked bewildered.</p>

<p>“Companies exist for economic value. And some guys exist in
companies for rain making,” Subroto Bagchi said, acquiring more and
more the demeanour of a wise old hermit for his age. “Rain making is
all about your disproportionate ability to create value out of nothing.”
That’s what those blokes do all the time in the software hotspots of the
west.</p>

<p>Rain maker, me. I’ve got a new identity badge for myself. On the wrong
side of 40, I know what will carry me ahead. If you find it hard to
believe, just go back to the first line of this column. Haven’t I got you
something out of nothing?</p>
