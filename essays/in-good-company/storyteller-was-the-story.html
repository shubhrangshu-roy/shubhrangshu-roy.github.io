<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / In Good Company</h5><br><h1>Storyteller was the story</h1><br><h5>2000-2006</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>I last met Bhai Mohan Singh five years ago. Last fortnight, he called it a
day. For India’s post-reforms generation, Bhai, as he was referred to,
founded Ranbaxy, among the world’s top ten generic drug makers
today. He was one of the four Midnight’s Children from Punjab who
emerged from the holocaust of Partition to script India’s biggest
corporate stories — H P Nanda built Escorts, Raunaq Singh Apollo
Tyres, Bhai Mohan Singh Ranbaxy and Brijmohan Lall Munjal Hero
Cycles and Hero Honda. Three of them have since signed off, and I
pray, God grant long life to Mr Munjal.</p>
<p>For historical sanctity, I am not including other prominent businessmen
from what’s now Pakistan, among the Fab Four — the late M S Oberoi
had arrived as a hotelier, first at Shimla, and then, Kolkata, even before
Partition. M L Mittal, father of the world’s biggest steel maker, L N Mittal
was a Marwari scrap-dealer in Karachi and a refugee, no doubt, but not
a Punjabi, and in any case, certainly didn’t script the kind of success
the Fab Four did. I also understand the Mahindras of Mumbai have
their roots in Pakistani Punjab, but I am not quite sure if their business
was born out of post-Partition trauma. As far as I know, they were
dealers for Jeep during the War and eventually became their licensed
manufacturer in India. Mr Keshub Mahindra can enlighten me on that.</p>
<p>Back to the Fab Four. I’ve met all of them at some point of time or the
other; either known them somewhat well or well enough indeed. Two of
them were were Mona Punjabis, and two, turbaned Sikhs. I found Bhai
Mohan Singh and Sardar Raunaq Singh, amazing storytellers. In their
lifetime, both scripted larger-than-life stories of themselves. And then, in
their very lifetime, both reduced themselves to footnotes in their own
story books. Blind love for their sons reduced them to dots. Let me
recount Bhai’s story.</p>
<p>Unlike most victims of Partition, Bhai’s family arrived in Delhi in style —
no tattered clothes, no refugee camps, no doles — they chartered an
entire plane from Rawalpindi to fly in kith and kin, with most of their
wealth intact, even after paying a ransom tax of Rs 5 crore (a very, very
big amount those days) to the emergent Pakistan government; in Delhi,
they checked in at the Imperial on Janpath. With no house to call home
in Delhi, Bhai soon invested in several bungalows, his first on Prithviraj
Road. Even today, his family should be the biggest landlord after the
government of India and Khushwant Singh in what Lutyen built as The
City.</p>
<p>Given to Sikhism, Bhai was the only son of a Hindu landlord and money
lender who made a neat pile during World War II, building PoW camps,
airfields and a highway to Rangoon from Assam, employing thousands
of Pathans and mules from Peshawar. In Delhi, Bhai resumed money
lending and financed a chemist’s shop at CP named Ranbaxy. And
when the store owner defaulted, he took over the shop. Soon, he shut
that store, and became Pfizer’s India distributor. Had I been him, I
would have lived happily ever after, but not so for Bhai. He found a
bigger opportunity in the ’50s, when Nehru ushered in the licence-
permit raj. So, when drug manufacturing and pricing were put under
control, Bhai sank cash into an antibiotics plant in Okhla in 1960 as an
equal joint venture partner with Lepitit of Italy. In five years, that JV
collapsed as Lepitit refused to transfer technology on time. Bhai bought
over his partner and Ranbaxy Labs was born. Over the next 30 years,
Bhai surrounded himself with technicians, pharmacists and chemists;
copied technology from Hungarians (part of the great Socialist
brotherhood where India was a cherished cousin), and made medicines
in frying pots and pans, flouting global patent norms. By 1978, he had
ventured into Nigeria, and soon after, set shop in Malaysia and
Thailand. Wisely, he also packed off his eldest son, Parvinder — a
chemistry topper from Stephen’s — to Michigan to pursue a PhD in
pharma on scholarship from Ranbaxy’s MNC competitor in India.
By the time India opened its doors to reforms, Bhai had built Ranbaxy
into India’s biggest drugs maker. And his story should have ended
there. The Midnight’s Children, all four of them, had prospered under
the licence-permit Raj, when older generations of family business had
collapsed.</p>
<p>Bhai was a wise man. So, he wanted to end his story the way he knew
it best. So, when came Manmohan Singh’s reforms in 1991, Bhai
mobilised public opinion from Left to Right to shut India’s doors to
competition and global patent norms. In normal course, he should have
won. But he hadn’t reckoned that his nemesis was an insider at home,
not an outsider.</p>
<p>Son Parvinder, who had returned from Michigan in ’67, was a truly
Global Indian, not taken to a partitioned view of the world. Parvinder
belonged to a borderless world and saw his fortune beyond India.
Today, 75% of Ranbaxy’s earnings come from global markets.
How that happened is another story.</p>
