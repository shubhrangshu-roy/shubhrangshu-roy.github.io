<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / In Good Company</h5><br><h1>Thank You Mr Mittal, But No Thank You</h1><br><h5>2000-2005</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>Take this for a fact. Indians who climb the ladder of success abroad,
don’t really make it good in India. That’s because the system still
stinks. The last time one heard of a takeover attempt by an NRI, the
system revolted so much that Lord Swraj Paul never really could make
his final comeback. That was a good 25 years ago. But then, the free-
market champions will say 25 years is history. There’s a short answer
to that: History repeats itself. Ask the Hinduja brothers. Liberalisation
brought the Hindujas out of the closet with promises of billion-dollar
investments in the country. And 15 years into reforms, the Hinduja
dream remains A Billion Dollar Baby. The sting of Bofors has consumed
the Hinduja enterprise here even as they keep reaping profits abroad.
There’s a message in it for the world’s third-richest man. Mr Lakshmi
Niwas Mittal, please keep off. Thank you for making it big, and we
Indians are proud of being counted at the top. But that’s only a Big
Thank You. Period.</p>

<p>Now just think of it, Mr Mittal, all it took you to emerge as the world’s
biggest steel manufacturer from scrap, was just 30 short years of hard
work outside India. In those 30 years, the only other Indian
businessman to have emerged on the Indian horizon in terms of the scale
of industrial enterprise was Dhirubhai Ambani. It took Mr Ambani his
God-given skills to manage the environment to reach where he did in
his lifetime, but he never bequeathed a fortune to his sons that were
anywhere in the league of global giants. The latest Forbes lists Mr
Mittal as the world’s third richest man with a personal fortune worth $25
billion ranks the Ambani brothers at 60 with a combined net worth of only
$7 billion. That’s as big as it gets. Even India’s software billionaire,
Azim Premji, who has ridden India’s best global bet, IT, into
international stardom ranks 30 with a net worth of just about $9.3
billion.</p>


<p>Frankly, having made it as the world’s largest steel maker, is it worth
the effort for Mr Mittal to look at his backyard in India? There’s little
reason for that other than sentimental (s)crap in case Mr Mittal is still
treading the consolidation or acquisitions route. Having acquired
operating facilities across 14 countries around the globe, there are still
enough pickings outside India to get him to move into Forbes's topmost
slot. For one, there’s always Arcelor, the world’s second-biggest steel
maker to affect the mother of all mergers. And that’s as big a challenge
as he could get. India, on the other hand, provides him with the
challenge of turning around a 100-year-old junkyard called Iisco in the
back of the beyond in West Bengal. Iisco, for the layman, was first
listed for privatisation when the economy opened some 15 years ago.
To date, it remains on the list, because of bureaucratic red tape and
trade unionism. Now look at that other century-old steel story out of
India: Tatas set up Tisco as a 100,000-tonne plant that has grown to 5
million tonnes in 100 years. As for the country’s total steel capacity, it
adds up to all of 33 million tonnes against Mr Mittal’s own 70 million
tonnes global capacity. This is when India is home to one of the world’s
largest iron ore deposits.</p>


<p>So what killed India’s steel story?</p>


<p>There are several reasons on offer. The country’s creaking roads, ports
and power stations have little to offer for global success. And despite
the much-touted reforms, bureaucratic red tape, militant trade unionism
and the all-pervading neta-babu-bania nexus render globalisation
stillborn, even when much of Mr Mittal’s global success has been
carved out of state-owned monopolies in the erstwhile Communist
empire.</p>


<p>It’s a free world outside. And Mr Mittal you know that best.
