<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / In Good Company</h5><br><h1>The retainer strikes back</h1><br><h5>2000-2006</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>The Birlas are it again, closing ranks to spar with an outsider over
control of an heirloom they consider should have stayed with the family.</p>

<p>The heirloom in question: a Rs 4,000 crore corporate fiefdom that an
heirless widow has bequeathed to a family retainer. Twenty years after
they separated, should the Birlas crib over the so-called loss of face?</p>

<p>To better understand the current controversy surrounding Priyamvada
Birla’s will that has the Birla clan red faced, one needs to first
understand why family businesses split. And why do family members
go their separate ways in choosing a successor of their individual
preference rather than think of the common good of the larger family.</p>

<p>Family business researchers often claim that the first generation builds
a successful business, the second generation lives off it and the third
generation have to start all over again after destroying what has been
inherited.</p>

<p>Frankly, this is true of most families in general, whether a particular
family is in business or not. Sociologists see in this a natural evolution
of the family tree where successions can be traced, in most cases, till
the fourth generation, or the fifth generation at a stretch, with the older
roots giving way to new-look tree. But why do families split? Most often
they split when what has been bequeathed to individuals do not add up
in equal measure among the several inheritors. It also depends on how
much of the perceived shine from the family silver rubs on to each
individual member of the clan. You could find the earliest traces of this
in the Mahabharata, where the third generation contested what was to
come to them by way of inheritance leading to a complete decimation of
an illustrious dynasty.</p>

<p>Researchers are now probing how family businesses survive
generation divides and live beyond the first 100 years. Statistically,
there aren’t too many examples of this. Independent research suggests
that about 13 per cent of once successful private businesses can
sustain themselves for 50 years. Of these, a third, or only four per cent
of the original 100 per cent can survive and grow. Of the four per cent
that last 50 years, only half grow as business and families. And a
quarter of them, or only one per cent of the original 100 per cent, grow
in 100 years. You have examples of this in the West — in the Henkel
family of Germany where 62 family members from the fourth and fifth
generation manage a $11.5 billion empire. Wal Mart, the world’s largest
family business is the other successful example. The Godrej Group is
perhaps the only Indian family business that has survived intact and
grown for 100 years, although the TVS and the Murugappa groups from
Chennai have survived as entities for nearly 90 years now.</p>

<p>According to Prof John L Ward of the Kellogg School, one thing
common to businesses that have sustained and grown is that their
business vision is very vague and ill-defined. They are very qualitative
and not at all quantitative. The ones that are much more compatible
and are likely to grow as family business don’t think of their enterprise
just as a business, but as an institution. They develop, nurture and
refine the philosophy of management. They have a coherent and
distinct philosophy of management.</p>

<p>Prof Ward also illustrates how successful families manage their
business: They focus on the institution by continually refining how they
manage, building an institution into an heirloom by protecting and
nourishing the institution. They allow the institution to build on
endurance and the flexibility of not being rigid. They do not just
concentrate on maximising profits. For them, profitability is a means to
an end and not an end itself. To realise this, they need a lot of
competence. And that competence comes from flexibility. They have
this lovely mixture of focus and flexibility, he says.</p>

<p>If you probe deeper into Indian family businesses, these factors are
clearly missing. Why? In most cases, it has to do with a lack of
corporate sensibility. Quite often, promoter-led businesses cannot
overcome the greed of aggrandisement. Their ego orientation is more
external, not internal, whereas for successful families, ownership is a
stewardship concept rather than a proprietary concept. They see that
some businesses can be divested to satisfy longer lasting ownership,
bringing in flexibility in the way businesses are run.</p>

<p>On the other hand, promoters of typical Indian family businesses
control the business without majority ownership, and financial
institutions that are supposed to have an independent say in the
management of business, usually do not have a very strong voice in
decision making, resulting in less stringent shareholder pressure. You
could call this a legacy of the licence-permit raj where businesses have
prospered despite high asset and raw material costs and not because
of competencies within the families and help from external advisors.</p>

<p>According to Dr Valentin von Massow of the Boston Consultancy
Group, “When families create a smoke screen, they don’t know how to
grow.”</p>

<p>This has been largely true of the Birlas. It has been true of the Modis,
the Singhanias and the Thapars, where promoters have run their
fiefdoms all by themselves and with the help of a few trusted retainers.</p>

Sadly, for the Birlas, once India’s most successful business family, the
time has come for the retainer to strike back.</p>
