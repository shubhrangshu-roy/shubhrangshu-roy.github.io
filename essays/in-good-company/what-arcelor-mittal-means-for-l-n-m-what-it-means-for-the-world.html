<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / In Good Company</h5><br><h3>LOOK AT IT THIS WAY</h3><br><h1>What ArcelorMittal means for LNM: what it means for the world</h1><br><h5>2000-2006</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>It can only get bigger than this. Sunday’s Arcelor-Mittal merger, the
biggest in the global steel business, can only be the beginning — the
surface of what appears on the surface. For Lakshmi Niwas Mittal,
global steel tycoon, and the world’s richest person (once more it’s time
to revise his ranking), from here on, it’s literally got to be one helluva
long Journey to the Centre of the Earth. That is, in case, he seeks
to control what’s at the core of this planet.</p>
<p>Why are we telling you this?</p>

<p>We are telling you this because Sunday’s conclusion of an eventful five-
the month-long campaign finally makes L N Mittal the undisputed monarch of the global iron and steel business that is at the heart of the world’s manufacturing establishment. And steel, as we know it, has its
applications in everything to do with you and me — from industrial
machinery and goods to construction material, transportation
equipment, household appliances, armaments, ships, automotive parts,
baked enamel finishes for automotive and appliances, catalysts,
medicines, biochemical, metallurgy, paints, printing, inks, plastics,
cosmetics, pins, artists' colours, laundry blue, paper dyes, fertiliser
ingredients, industrial finishes, pigments, polishing compounds, ferrites,
electronics, magnets, high-frequency cores and much more.</p>
<p>So, what does ArcelorMittal mean for LNM?</p>

<p>The world’s total steel capacity, as it stands now, is roughly 1.2 billion
tonnes. At a combined capacity of 130 million tonnes of steel that
ArcelorMittal fetches him, and LNM gets to control about 10% of the global steel capacity. His nearest competitor Nippon Steel controls barely 3%. Should that be enough for Mr Mittal? That depends on what sense the world makes of his deal-making capacity. But to give you a rough sense of what could be in store, while Sunday’s deal is significant and
certainly huge, there’s plenty more iron right below the surface.</p>

<p>And it’s still anybody’s business. Let’s tell you how:</p>
<p>While it’s true that ArcelorMittal gives LNM control of 10% of global
steel output, it makes him master of only .5% of the total iron equivalent
ores available on the earth’s surface. There’s much more in the
deepest recesses of this planet.</p>
<p>To give you an idea, the Earth’s mass, or weight, is 6,587 billion billion
tonnes (rpt billion billion tonnes). Iron (Fe) comprise 35.1% of that
mass, or 2,312 billion billion tonnes (rpt billion billion tonnes). Most of it
is buried in the Earth’s core, 3,000 km below the surface, and still
beyond the reach of the modern mind and technology.</p>
<p>Geologists say the Earth’s core comprises a fluid outer core and a solid
inner core. The solid inner core is roughly the size of the Moon and the
outer liquid core is the size of Mars. The inner core is an iron ball, 1,500
miles across, covered by a liquid casing, and 4,300 miles wide. For billions
of years, molten iron has seeped through fissures and cracks right
through the earth’s mantle and solidified as ore across vast tracts of
the earth’s surface or crust. Iron ore forms 5% of the earth’s crust. And
98% of the ore goes into the making of steel. Geologists estimate
worldwide iron ore resources at 800 billion tonnes, containing more
than 230 billion tonnes of iron. Right now, about 1.2 billion tonnes of
that iron finds its way to the marketplace each year. From now on,
ArcelorMittal will account for 130 million-tonne of that market.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more to be mined. Good luck Arcelor Mittal. So, let the
party begin.

<p>Provided the world hasn’t satiated its appetite, of course.</p>
