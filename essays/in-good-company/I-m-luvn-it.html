<h5>THE ECONOMIC TIMES / In Good Company</h5><br><h1>I’m luvn’ it!</h1><br><h5>2000-2006</h5><br><h5>Shubhrangshu Roy</h5><br>

<p>I’m luvin’ it! And how? To stretch a short story long, I’ve just discovered
the transmigration of the soul inside the Big Mac burger. Lemme guide you there. Only the other day, Vikram Bakshi, McDonald’s franchisee in
town, walked into our office, PowerPoint, projector, PR et al,
proclaiming that in the 10 years that it’s been around, McDonald’s
worked wonders in India when KFC failed. To me, it looks the other way
around. India’s worked wonders for McDonald’s when it failed just about
every other multinational fast-food joint. And there’s a lesson in it for
the mascot Ronald McDonald. I’ll tell him how. But, first things, first. </p>

<p>There’s a certainty to Mr Bakshi’s McBoast. And given the empirical evidence he furnishes there’s little doubt he has been a win-win story so far. In the decade it’s been around, McDonald’s has grown from two outlets in Delhi to 85 restaurants and four food courts across north and west India, each posting an average revenue of Rs 2.5 crore a year; its gross turnover growing at 40% CAGR.</p>

<p>What’s more, unlike other urban American legends that have been
pasted all over, pelted with stones or battered by commies and
communalists alike, I don’t quite know of anyone around who’s even
raised an eyebrow at Americana’s biggest symbol in India. Small
wonder then, Mr Bakshi says, India’s emerging as the fastest growth story
among the 31,000 McDonald’s outlets across the world. And this is only
the start. The future ought to be bigger. What’s up?</p>

<p>If I bought the McDonald’s story, Indians are among the world’s
youngest people with huge consumption expenses and discretionary
spending habits. Of every 100 Indians who go out shopping, 70 eat out
as well, and 40 seek outdoor entertainment. They are now splurging on
McDonald’s. So far, so good. But that’s old hat too. If Indians are biting
into McDonald’s, there’s no reason why they shouldn’t be digging into
KFC as well. And that’s where the real story lies hidden, literally
between the buns. KFC bombed India because it tried replacing our
desi tandoori kukkad with American fried chicken. McDonald’s worked
because it replaced the burger inside its buns.</p>

<p>Two years into its India launch, McDonald’s first replaced its
traditional beef patties with mutton burgers. But when that failed, it went
for a soul transplant, keeping its image intact. McDonald’s scripted its
dramatic India story out of our grandma’s home recipe; at 16% of total
sales, its McAloo Tikki Burger is a chartbuster and the single-biggest-
selling products in India, followed, of course, by Veg Pizza McPuff. What
does it say?</p>

<p>McDonald’s worked in India because despite its all-American golden
arches, it sublimated its existence to the quintessential Indian
consciousness, delinking its body from its soul. And it did so 50 years
after it first set shop across America selling hamburgers that trace their
origins 800 years earlier to Mongol warlord Genghis Khan’s camp,
before sublimating Russian tastebuds, and then, sailing into New York
harbour two centuries ago via Hamburg, and finally reinvading Russia
and China, besides 117 other countries, is the $20-billion great
American 20th-century fast food wonder served 50 million customers
each day.</p>

<p>Yet, in the 50 years that it’s successfully been around, there’s been
more to McDonald’s than burgers: Children in the US, Spain and
England has been reported to have suffered food poisoning, eating
E.coli-infected beef burgers. McDonald’s has been accused of paying sub-minimum wages. And it’s been the subject of the McLibel, the longest trial in English legal history. The verdict delivered in June 1997, ruled that
McDonald’s “exploit children’ with their advertising, produce
‘misleading’ advertising, are ‘culpably responsible’ for cruelty to
animals, are ‘antipathetic’ to unionisation and pay their worker's low
wages. A further court ruling to an appeal in ’99 pronounced: “If one
eats enough McDonald’s food, one’s diet may well become high in fat
etc., with the very real risk of heart disease.” In just about the time that
it’s been in India, McLibel went on the spawn anti-McDonald’s
campaign worldwide. A feature-length documentary was broadcast
across the world, and the McLibel website was born. Stung by these
charges, McDonald’s announced early this year upcoming menu
changes that will emphasise chicken, salads, and other fresh food
rather than hamburgers. How I wish, they opt for McAloo, instead. Now
that it’s found its soul in India, the good ol’ burger can seek global
salvation at last. For you can find the seeds of global consciousness in,
of all things, the aloo. A native of Peru, the potato transmigrated to
Europe abroad Spanish colonial vessels to become a Continental
staple. The Irish transplanted it to North America, while the Portuguese
brought it to India.</p>

<p>To quote the scriptures: aham brahmasmi, tatvam asi. I am the
consciousness, and so are you. For McDonald’s, that consciousness
has got to be the aloo!</p>
