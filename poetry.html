      <div class="cardcontent"><br>
As in the constant battles<br>
Between good and evil,<br>
Between gods and demons,<br>
Between sky and earth,<br>
Between rain and drought,<br>
So, too, there is a never ending war<br>
Between sacred unadulterated speech <br>
And bright intense poetry.<br>
For, poetry is the mistress of deception,<br>
Endowed with the quality of the seer,<br>
Who sees...<br>
Hears...<br>
Speaks...<br>
Twisting words<br>
That are unspoken...<br>
Unheard...<br>
Unseen.<br>
Like the friseur<br>
Who grooms the tresses<br>
As companion to the fair maiden<br>
And, in doing so,<br>
Brings the dead<br>
Back to life.<br>
And in that twisting and turning<br>
Of the unrelenting war<br>
Virtue suffers a million deaths<br>
Bringing great grief.<br>
And yet, in the isolation<br>
Of that standalone win,<br>
Poetry is reduced<br>
To penury and abstinence<br>
Leaving the field barren<br>
For sacred speech<br>
To sprout once more!<br>
In a neverending<br>
Play of Shadows.<br><br><br>

        That stuff of life is gathered<br>
        To awaken the beasts that fly<br>
        That forage, that dwell<br>
        In the glow of lamp<br>
        Born to the chants that rhyme in steps <br>
        Making connections. <br>
<br>
        In the clatter of teeth where cattle abound <br>
        Where that One shares in the many a multitude <br>
        The mouth the mind<br>
        The arms the strength<br>
        The thighs power<br>
        The feet the ground<br>

        The head the sky, the feet the h/earth <br>
        The ears the ways of sound<br>
        And this world set to clockwork motion <br>

        As that One dons the seven shades <br>
        And thrice as many in its streams <br>
        As the senses gather around the pit<br>
        To make the offering once more <br>
        In this lamp of that fire<br>
        To shed this one in spurts<br>
        In its own image of One too many<br>
        That One now, resting in this one, the other.<br><br><br>

This is Tom. He could well be Dick.<br>
This is Pu. She could well be Puss.<br>
How did Tom and Pu get there?<br>
For heaven’s sake, they can’t quite tell.<br>
For, they never sought the road to hell.<br>
So, here’s what Dick and Puss wish to know<br>
While you cuss and curse<br>
And swear and shout.<br>
What got you going to push us in<br>
Right into the choking well; who flushed us<br>
Out the stinking drain?<br>
That nearly drowned us in trauma, pain<br>
Alive! You’ll never know, mom, how it feels<br>
To swallow all your toxic waste:<br>
Blood and acid and pee and poop<br>
While going down that constricted chute<br>
As you rant and rave.<br>
And still you wail since, long, and loud<br>
In bitterness, not knowing love<br>
Begets pain, ’fore pain begets love<br>
Suffer you did at birth no doubt; so did we.<br>
Then why still feed your shitpot woes?<br>
The memory of pain is just a thought.<br>
O mama dear! Be kind, be sweet.<br>
Why scream and scorn <br>
And us ill-treat?<br>
From (our) birth till (your) death<br>
We do not part, dear Ma, O dear!<br>
In dignity, grace let’s make fresh start.<br>

  The language of poetry traverses a wide and variegated landscape. Lament has been penned in the image and idiom of populist feminazi literature, that seeks to reduce motherhood to perverse pain and indignity of the woman’s soul in search of liberation and equality.<br>
It needn’t be so. <br>
Apart from borrowing notes from contemporary counter narrative on motherhood, the tone and tenor of this post does not seek to offend individual sensitivities.<br>
Instead, it seeks to reassert that the birth of a child is a sacred passage of a pilgrim from ‘outerspace’ to this beautiful paradise we call earth.<br>
In the four billion-year-old history of the known Universe, there is no evidence yet of life on any other planet, star or galaxy.<br>
Motherhood must necessarily mean cherishing this painful privilege of birthing new life that is sacred and worth preserving, not because it’s a woman’s bounden duty to do so, but because there is no other option.<br>
True, women must be empowered. There’s no dispute on that. Educated women deserve to fly First Class on their own terms, by their own sweat, as much as their educated spouses aspire to do. There’s no second guessing on that either.<br>
It’s then, the poor, illiterate mother who lacks an option. But, even in her suffering and pain and humiliation and sacrifice, she respects her sanctity of birthing. She’s really the one who needs a choice.<br>
Without exception, that choice of birthing, and when and how, must exclusively be the mother’s prerogative, irrespective of whether she is rich or poor, educated or illiterate.
The mother, the woman, must make that choice.<br>
But, equally, she must not denigrate that one chance of life’s regeneration in this unimaginably vast Universe, with expletives that spout forth from her flaming tongue.<br>
For, the chant alone is sacred. And the birth alone is sacred.<br>
And that sacred journey to heaven on earth must necessarily be walked through hell both by mother and child. That’s how nature ordained it at conception.<br>
There’s no other path to tread.<br>
Motherhood, above anything else, is the tunnel to reigniting the lamp of life. So that one lamp might light another.<br>
Generation after generation after generation!<br>
But to light that lamp, the wick too must burn.<br>
Generation after generation after generation!<br>
Thank you, mother, for giving me life. Thank you all mothers as well, this Mother's Day, today... and everyday!<br>

          <b>Gabriella:</b> ’Sup, sweet bitch, in your world of colour-en-scent?<br><br>

          <b>Lucifera:</b> Scorchin’, young lass, with pain of burning flesh that lusts-en-craves.<br><br>

          <b>Gabriella:</b> Aha! pretty bird, they still sing your paens at Cinema Paradiso<br>
Can’t you darn your wings back to shape?<br><br>

<b>Lucifera:</b> Ah, Gabriella! Have you heard not my magic whisper? Come, read my lips.<br>
My chalice long smashed to smithereens.<br>
For Hollywood’s sake, I can’t return to your utterly dull, plastic world, devoid of gloss-en-glam.<br>
For the one who despaired to poison this world with passion, why surrender my cravings?<br><br>

<b>Gabriella:</b> You lost your place at suppa, the last one, when you painted the Virgin naked, lowering His gaze before the fireflies.<br><br>

<b>Lucifera:</b> Glowworms? Fire ignited the glow in this spec of dust-en-dirt.<br>
He messed with me, so, my bit(t)e(r) alone concocted Adam’s heady cocktail.<br>
While you play lock(h)er room from the comfort of your couch, guess who’s caught in hellfire -- you or I?<br>
Barbie waits on me, helpless, and so does hapless Elle, as my lusty pout pummels bottle after bottle, one decanter after another, a glass once more, a sip at a time.<br>
Suffocating within your walls, go ask God, the Virgin, the Virus, this one last thing: Who coloured Adam’s drink with scarlet drops?<br>
I prick His heart with my needle eyes.<br>
And you toast: “Cheers! All-a-you! I luv U! Allahu!”<br><br><br></div>

I pray not to be steered<br>
Into a safe harbour<br><br>

When caught unawares<br>
In the fierce storm of life<br><br>

All I wish for instead:<br>
May I not cower in fear<br><br>

When dark calamity haunts <br>
My existence on earth<br><br>

It’s okay if you are unable<br>
To douse the flaming pain of my soul<br><br>

All I pray for, instead, is the strength<br>
To overcome my uninvited sorrow<br><br>

I ask not for you to lend me your hand.<br>
That’s fine. May my resolve not waver<br><br>

When my world is visited upon by harm<br>
And I am heaped upon with scorn<br><br>

May I never be rescued by you, my dear<br>
Just grant me the strength to soldier on<br><br>

I ask not of you to bear my burden<br>
Nor do I crave to be consoled in gloom<br><br>

All I fervently hope for is to swim<br>
Through the calamitous tide of time<br><br>

May I behold your stupendous face<br>
In the bright morning Sun forever<br><br>

But in the tipping moment of the dark night<br>
When the world rises against me in one<br><br>

May I not lose my faith one bit in you.<br>
My love!

      <div class="cardcontent"><br>
Why the heck must I falter door to door,<br>
When I carry strength on my able feet<br>
When right ahead of me there runs<br>
A long expanse of cobbled street.<br><br>

May I not rest till I reach my goal<br>
For, it’s my job... to keep walking<br>
I say something, I hear something<br>
I share some load along the way<br><br>

It’s great I got to meet you darling<br>
You helped me cover a good distance.<br>
What else should I call myself, Walker?!<br>
For, it’s my job ... to keep walking.<br><br>

Walking through this half-life of mine<br>
I gain something, I lose something<br>
Surrounded by hope ‘n’ despair<br>
I laugh sometime, I cry sometime.<br><br>

Heed: never give up, no matter what<br>
For, it’s my job...  to keep walking<br>
We wade thru the vicissitudes of time<br>
In this giant Universe we call our home<br><br>

Who else is there who does not bear<br>
Joys and sorrows of life, like u and me<br>
Why must I crib then: Time’s running against me<br>
For, it’s my job... to keep walking.<br><br>

I kept wandering door to door<br>
In search of that elusive fullness of life<br>
But, the cobbles stood up against my feet<br>
With every step I took down the street.<br>

This is what life’s about, why must I despair then<br>
For, it’s my job...  to keep walking<br>
Some walk with me along the way<br>
Others turn back halfway through<br><br>

But the momentum of life relentlessly runs<br>
Whoever falls, must fall behind<br>
Joy finally comes to the one who walks.<br>
The one and only... who keeps walking.

My Ka’abah, qibla, mosque you are,<br>
And steps leading to them you too<br>
My Quran you are, my rights you too <br>
My duties and pilgrimage you too<br>
My doles and prayer you are<br>
My piety too, my piety too<br><br>

My knowledge …<br>
Remembrance, contemplation<br>
Delight, <br>
Ecstasy and love you are<br>
My light you too, my hope you too<br>
My desires, gains, setbacks you too<br><br>

You are all I see around, <br>

It’s you I seek now …<br>
And forever search <br>

The chill of my breath you are<br>
The storm of my tears you too<br><br>

My mole you are, my hair you are<br>

My lonelieness, excitement, craze you are<br>
My tear too, my grief you too <br>
You are my beginning, my end you are<br>
My hidden revelation that too you too<br>
You are my thunder, my rain you too<br><br>

My land beloved, scorching desert <br>
My rivulet and sand dunes you too<br>
O Beloved, you take me, The One,<br>
My sovereign you shall be then too<br>
My Sultan then shall be you too<br>
My bass rhythm and string apart<br>
My destination you are, my destiny too.

      <div class="cardcontent"><br>
How do I praise you?<br>
O light divine!<br>
That fires my being, that warms my heart<br>
That glows my soul, with true love of desire<br>
That makes the world go round and round?<br>
<br>
La la Lord<br>
A la Lord<br>
La la Lord<br>
A la hu!<br>
<br>
Wherever I turn, your grace you light <br>
You call to prayer in the niche of my heart<br>
The one and the only, the you forever<br>
Your mystery revels in hide-n-seek<br>
<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
That’s all that’s said is all that’s done<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master <br>
That’s all that’s said is all that’s done<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
<br>
Why seek then, the hand of love;<br>
Why seek the balm from another hand?<br>
When you’re the one who goes round and round, <br>
With love and care to heal our wound<br>
Your door, then, must we knock forever<br>
<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
That’s all that’s said is all that’s done<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master <br>
That’s all that’s said is all that’s done<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
<br>
You are<br>
You are, you are<br>
You are<br>
You are, you are<br>
A la hu, you are<br>
<br>
O master, O master<br>
Creator, nourisher<br>
When lost to the world<br>
And lost forever<br>
You are the one and only refuge<br>
When devious darkness descends on us<br>
You brighten our lives in the glow of dawn<br>
The moon and the stars are all your making<br>
In them you shine as light divine<br>
<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
That’s all that’s said is all that’s done<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master <br>
That’s all that’s said is all that’s done<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
<br>
In poverty I seek to scale rich heights<br>
Now watch my destiny take flight <br>
You erased my errors, the world didn’t see <br>
You seized my heart with clemency…<br>
<br>
Why seek the favour of one n all?<br>
Why reveal my state to one and all?<br>
When you shall bestow whatever I desire<br>
Your door’s next door for me to knock on<br>
<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
That’s all that’s said is all that’s done<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master <br>
That’s all that’s said is all that’s done<br>
It’s all your doing, my love, my master<br>
<br>
You are lord, god, master forever<br>
Sustainer, nourisher of world and whirls<br>
To you we bow here, hereafter<br>
You are the beginning, you are the end <br>
You are the one and the only forever<br>
Where all we go is where all we praise <br>
The one that sustains our world and whirls<br>
To you we bow here, hereafter<br>
You are the beginning, you are the end<br>
You are the one and the only forever

      <div class="cardcontent"><br>
Shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
Shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
Brother dear, where to find you<br>
Once Zainab gets back home?<br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
Allah dear, our tent destroyed<br>
Ruination knocked down our home<br>
That’s now Zainab’s lifeless abode<br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
With Qasim-Abbas gone waste <br>
Akbar, Asghar slaughtered as well<br>
Who’s left to welcome her home?<br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
When curious neighbours begin to ask<br>
How her arm’s turned deep blue<br>
Who will she turn to? <br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
Lungs bursting, she steps indoors<br>
Remembering her dearest bro <br>
Her heart swoons with every step<br>
He’s gone to return no more <br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
Silence may speak a thousand words,<br>
But how can she do so?<br>
Without a word from brother dear <br>
Zainab can live no more.<br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
Her face unveiled, fetters unchained<br>
Even death eludes Zainab<br>
There’s no telling what suffering await …<br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab

    <div class="card card-tall"><div class="cardcontent cardTitle">The Honeysuckle!</div>
      <div class="cardcontent"><br>
        The Universe, and everything we see of it, <br>
        Is make-belief. <br>
        You make. <br>
        I believe. <br>
        You unmake. <br>
        I remake.<br>
        Come to think of it: <br>
        Your dream. My daydream. <br>
        Your darkness. My delusion. <br>
        Someone's already been there, done that!<br>
        It's just that the patterns kept changing <br>
        While I peeped inside your kaleidoscope.<br>
        So, be warned. I am not the eternal, ephemeral Virgin.<br>
        Your mind is just another honeysuckle that bloomed in sunshine.<br>
        There's no point running between fact and fiction.<br>
        It's the chase alone that jostles for space.<br>
        Then what's the truth really all about? <br>
        Does it exist?<br>
        You need to dig deeper. And deeper. <br>
        Now, and forever.<br>
        For, you can never immerse in the nectar of the honeysuckle by alighting on its petals.<br>
        And yet, I may choose to alight on the petals alone.<br>
        I may be in love with the delight of the honeysuckle that dips its head in shame.<br>
        Small wonder, then, the dip is so frightfully deep.<br>
        Do I need to dive the depths to suckle.... the honey?<br>
        I must find out.<br>
        Which is why you must ask.<br>
        Or is it that you are scared? Too scared.<br>
        Did I ever try to dig the deep?<br>
        Did you ever try and choke on breath?<br>
        Did I ever dive and drown?<br>
        Because you were so much in love with your pleasing crimson petals.<br>
        And that's alright.<br>
        Because that illusory ideal may well lead the honeysuckle <br>
        To its best flush yet.<br>
        Sometimes, your lie can lead me to my own truth: I can.<br>
        After all, it's all mental contortion.<br>
        Like the butterfly curling its snoot on itself.<br>
        For, once the monarch butterfly uncurls its snoot to suckle the honey, it invariably curls it back again to the vast emptiness where it belongs, <br>
        Each curl a subtle interruption in the flow <br>
        Of the nectar that oozes forth from within you, the honeysuckle.<br>
        Each flutter of the wings, a chant that strings together his Universe.<br>
        Come to think of it. Think hard.<br>

    <div class="card"><div class="cardcontent cardTitle">The Spiraline Centre! <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i></div>
      <div class="cardcontent"><br>
        For, when the serpent uncurls, you invariably come to nothing without a core.<br>
  There's no centre. <br>
  The spiraline power that uncurls to hiss, curls back into the silence of its core... the metaphysical dot.<br>
  Each curl a subtle interruption issuing from its own flow and absorbed within her.<br>
  Each hiss, a chant that strings together her own Universe.<br>
  And that Universe emerges and dissolves as the serpentine force curls and uncurls... <br>
  Curls and uncurls...curls and uncurls.<br>
  The dark nothingness that voids the Universe is all in the outer space ... <br>
  A self effulgent vaccum that feels no need to be filled. <br>
  No need to be fulfilled. <br>
  That's where you reach when you ask.<br>
  Come, ask. And why not?<br>
  Come, ask the teacher. What's the question?<br>
  For, the question itself hides the 'quest' for answer.<br>
  Can the two of us embrace each other: The quest and the question?<br>
  Come, ask and you shall know.<br>
  For, to ask is to thirst for.<br>
  For, the one who knows, seeks.<br>

        <div class="cardcontent"><br>
          I live between Birth and Death<br>
  Propelled by a Force…mighty<br>
  Active in my Being<br>
  In transit…growing, growing, growing<br>
  Of body and mind.<br>
   <br>
  Life happens…in a Split…in a magnificent moment,<br>
  As I journey from State to Station.<br>
  I Give, so that you may Get<br>
  As I reach for journey’s end.<br>
  And thus, I paint my Icon in you<br>
  Of the Self in the other Self<br>
  Through All that is…<br>
  But an Idea.<br>
   <br>
  At my core is the idea of me<br>
  That has no Beginning or End…<br>
  Riding the Cycle of the Birth and Death of I.<br>
  Shedding my several shadows…<br>
  In my eternal passage through time and space.<br>
   <br>
  I am Self-evident<br>
  I am Self-reliant<br>
  In the sum whole of the I in me…<br>
  In the manifest<br>
  And the unmanifest<br>
  That is in the Nature of I and all<br>
  That is created … and uncreated…<br>
  Co-related … co-dependent.<br>
   <br>
  And the Force of nature and that Nature of force<br>
  Never were One born and the Other dead<br>
  Pervading the emptiness without<br>
  Pervading the emptiness within<br>
  In the immeasurable Hole<br>
  And the measurable Dot<br>
   <br>
  Beyond the realm of the known and the unknown.<br>
  In the Eye of God<br>
  In the i of me<br>
  Brought together by Hope, measured by Faith<br>
  En route my passage to Heaven<br>
  On Earth, on my way through Hell…<br>
  I find Love…<br>
  In my idea of me,<br>
  In my image in you.<br>
   <br>
  Born out of which is the basis<br>
  That brings the I and the Icon together<br>
  In the fullness of the I<br>
  In Heaven<br>
  So that I live once more<br>
  In You!<br>
