          <p>Shubhrangshu Roy is a bard who divides his time between the US and India. His latest work  Shadows of the Fragmented Moon (February 2022), is a composition of 108 mystic chants that navigate ancient Indic thought to plunge deep into the human psyche. His first book Zara’s Witness (March 2019) is a work of mythical literature that reimagines India’s ancient Upanishadic thought as a contemporary lore exploring the human soul.</p>

<p>Hey, Ze, a modern epic drama in two volumes, places India in the midst of its contemporary civilisational shift through an ever-changing narrative between its two protagonists, a Hindu and a Muslim, to explore an extensive and diverse range of philosophical musings from history to politics, religion, nationalism, society, employment, culture, travel, literature, poetry, music, relationships, love, hate, sex, spirituality and divinity in the everyday life of two individuals. The work is now waitlisted for publication.</p>

<p>Roy is currently working on his next major project to explain the real essence of Hinduism to Hindus. He plans to follow that work with explaining Islam to Muslims. </p>

<p>A prequel to Zara’s Witness, penetrating the deepest mysteries of the Vedas is further down the line. His other major work, The Flow (available on Facebook, and being transplanted here) is an episodic learning of Vedic wisdom through nuggets of daily thoughts covering an entire year.</p>

<p>Roy is an inspired poet. Besides his original renditions, he continues to both translate and transcreate poems from the Indian vernacular, a sampling of which is available on this website. </p>

<p>In his previous avatar, Roy was a successful business journalist in India for three decades without any formal academic grounding either in economics or business. In 2008, he launched the Financial Chronicle, until recently India's youngest business daily, as its first and last Editor-in-chief and Chief Operating Officer. In that capacity he managed a successful partnership with The International Herald Tribune, the erstwhile global edition of The New York Times, between 2008 and 2012. Roy managed the Financial Chronicle for eight years before it closed down under the weight of intellectual and financial bankruptcy of its publishers.</p>

<p>Shubhrangshu is known in his profession for the high standards of editorial integrity and intellectual honesty both in his personal endeavours and as team leader.</p>

<p>The biggest recognition of his credibility came from none other than Ratan Tata, then Tata Group chairman, who wrote on January 6, 2012:</p>

<p>“I do read the Financial Chronicle every morning and find it refreshingly different from some of the other more sensation oriented newspapers that one finds oneself reading every day.”</p>

<p>Roy is a gifted writer and is known for his in-depth analysis of economic and political issues. He is also known for his wide contacts across the industry and administrative spectrum. He has travelled extensively in the country and abroad.</p>

<p>For eight years running, till 2019, Shubhrangshu has been the only Indian editor on the judges’ panel of Asia’s most respected journalism award, Society of Publishers in Asia -- SOPA AWARDS for Excellence in Journalism. In a personal capacity, Shubhrangshu, alongside video game developer and private astronaut Richard Garriot de Cayeux, became Executive Producer of The First Orbit, Christopher Riley’s 2011 real time re-creation of history's first human spaceflight by Yuri Gagarin on 12th April, 1961.</p>

<p>Prior to launching Financial Chronicle, he spent 20 years as a journalist with various publications, 12 of which were spent at the Times Group, primarily in senior editorial functions at The Economic Times. </p>

<p>Shubhrangshu is based in Bethesda, Maryland, since November 2021.</p>

           <p>Roy joined the Financial Express in 1987 as a rookie after a one-month internship at the Hindustan Times as part of his PG journalism programme. His first major assignment at FE was the coverage of the farmers’ agitation in western UP under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Tikait in the winter of 1987-88.</p>
           <p>At FE, he also reported extensively on India’s policy reviews by the Rajiv Gandhi government on privatisation of the defence-industrial complex and the power sector, besides the merger of the Union ministries of industry and commerce on the lines of Japan’s MITI. All these changes became reality only over the next 25 years.</p>
           <p>Shubhrangshu has studied at well-known missionary schools.</p>
           <p>He passed ICSE (Class X) in 1980 and ISC (Class XII) in 1982.</p>
           <p>Roy graduated with Honours in Political Science from Jadavpur University, Calcutta in 1985.</p>
           <p>He belongs to the 1987 class of journalism at the Indian Institute of Mass Communications, Delhi.</p></div></div></div></div>
