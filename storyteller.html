        <p>Shubhrangshu Roy, 59, is the author of two books - Zara’s Witness, a philosophical fantasy, launched in March 2019, and Shadows of The Fragmented Moon, a collection of poems, launched in February 2022. He is the founding editor of Financial Chronicle, which until recently was India’s youngest business daily. As Editor-in-chief of Financial Chronicle and Chief Operating Officer of its holding company Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd, Shubhrangshu has managed a team of highly-skilled journalists and support professionals in printing, marketing and distribution functions. His tenure at Financial Chronicle and Deccan Chronicle Holdings ended on 31 August, 2016.</p>
<p>Shubhrangshu is known in his profession for the high standards of editorial integrity and intellectual honesty both in his personal endeavours and as team leader.</p>
<p>The biggest recognition of his credibility came from none other than Ratan Tata, then Tata Group chairman, who wrote on January 6, 2012:</p>
<p>“I do read the Financial Chronicle every morning and find it refreshingly different from some of the other more sensation oriented newspapers that one finds oneself reading every day.”</p>
<p>Roy is a gifted writer and is known for his in-depth analysis of economic and political issues. He is also known for his wide contacts across the industry and administrative spectrum. He has travelled extensively in the country and abroad.</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2012, Shubhrangshu managed a successful partnership with The International Herald Tribune, the global edition of The New York Times. That partnership terminated with the winding up of the IHT title by New York Times.</p>
<p>For eight years running, till 2019, Shubhrangshu has been the only Indian editor on the judges’ panel of Asia’s most respected journalism award, Society of Publishers in Asia -- SOPA AWARDS for Excellence in Journalism.
In a personal capacity, Shubhrangshu, alongside video game developer and private astronaut Richard Garriot de Cayeux, became Executive Producer of The First Orbit, Christopher Riley’s 2011 real time re-creation of history's first human spaceflight by Yuri Gagarin on 12th April, 1961.</p>
<p>Prior to launching Financial Chronicle, he spent 20 years as a journalist with various publications, 12 of which were spent at the Times Group, primarily in senior editorial functions at The Economic Times.
Shubhrangshu is based in Bethesda, Maryland,  since November 2021.</p>

       <div class="storyteller-block"><div class="narrow"><div class="cardBig"><div class="heading">PROFILE</div><div class="profile-text"><p>Shubhrangshu Roy launched the Financial Chronicle on April 16, 2008, at the height of the US sub-prime crisis, in less than three months of the newspaper’s announcement on January 22; he launched all its five editions within a span of 12 months, through the excruciating months of the global economic meltdown; he launched its Weekend issue on September 10, 2011.</p>
           <p>Shubhrangshu also conceptualised and launched www.mydigitalfc.com, which was originally designed and intended as India’s first business networking platform.
           Mydigitalfc.com was also the first Indian print/digital media platform to experiment with mobile journalism (now popularly known as ‘mojo”) by empowering reporters with smartphones to broadcast live video interviews.</p>
           <p>His other pioneering works at FC include three successive “Signature Editions” of the annual Budget issues, personally autographed by the then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, the annual yearend feature on the FC Businessman of the Year, which was recognised in corporate circles for its incisive analysis and unbiased selection procedure. Besides, the annual New Year special issue was very well accepted both in intellectual circles and among FC’s committed readers.</p>
           <p>Roy introduced the concept of “comic book” style of reporting on personal finance that was subsequently adopted for investor education by leading Indian insurance companies at the behest of the Union finance ministry. He also created an exclusive first-of-its-kind beat on sustainable luxury by inducting a British research scholar in his team to write exclusively on the subject.</p>
           <p>These records remain unsurpassed in Indian media.</p>
           <p>At launch of the Delhi edition of Financial Chronicle, the then prime minister, Dr Manhmohan Singh observed in a written message:</p>
           <p>“It is noteworthy that a business paper is being launched from the capital at a time when the economy is experiencing major challenges. These are challenging times for policymakers, businesses and investors. At this crucial juncture, reporting on business issues objectively and with brevity is the need of the hour. I am confident that Financial Chronicle would play a positive and constructive role with responsible reportage and contribute to informed and intellectual debate in the country.”</p>
           <p>Before taking up his last assignment at DCHL in November 2007, Shubhrangshu worked for the strategic business group of Bennett, Coleman & Co Ltd., publishers of The Times of India and The Economic Times. There he directly related to the company’s board of directors, as member of its brains trust. He was part of the BCCL strategic team for the six months in 2007, where he spearheaded key strategic investment concepts in frontier areas as an ideator, creative thinker and negotiator.</p>
           <p>Prior to taking up the assignment at BCCL, Roy had been a journalist for 20 years, of which he spent 11 years at The Economic Times, successfully researching and executing new journalistic concepts in writing, editing, design and production.</p>
           <p>During his stint at The Economic Times, he is credited with the Indian media’s only on-record interview with Manmohan Singh as the country’s prime minister. Roy pioneered the coverage of national elections in ET between 1996 and 2004, which were recognised as best in class among all mainstream dailies. He has reported and commented on every national election since 1989.</p>
           <p>Roy has interviewed leading global CEOs in the decade of the 1990s, including Paul A Allaire, chairman and CEO, Xerox Corp; Alex J Trotman, chairman Ford Motor Co.; Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and CEO Compaq Computer Corp; Charles Miller Smith, chairman ICI plc; Yves Carcelle, president and CEO Louis Vuitton; and Lynn Forester de Rothschild, president and CEO ELR Holdings LLC, among others. He extensively reported on the India strategies of IBM, Xerox, Compaq, LMVH, Enron and other Fortune 500 companies.</p>
           <p>At home, Roy has made successful forays in reporting on the business of poverty in one of India’s remotest districts, Kalahandi in Orissa. He has also reported on rural prosperity in Punjab, separatism in Kashmir, and has spent 36 hours locked up inside a successful Bangalore-based software firm, exploring and reporting on the hidden world of Indian technology artisans.</p>
           <p>Roy has reported extensively on the family histories of India’s big businesses. He was part of ET’s core team for its annual Budget editions, and subsequently at FC, designed and spearheaded its Budget coverage, which was repeatedly peer reviewed as the best in print journalism for seven years running.</p>
           <p>In his editorial assignment at ET as Senior Editor he revamped the newspaper’s Sunday edition as an exclusive upper crust product focusing on India’s super rich. While revamping Sunday ET, Shubhrangshu created a new beat for business journalists in the film and entertainment sector.</p>
           <p>Roy’s other successful engagements with ET included launch of the paper’s Chandigarh edition. He also strategised and executed the revamp of ET’s Ahmedabad edition and the upcountry (outstation) edition of ET Delhi. Besides, he launched the popular feature supplement ET Travel. At ET, he also wrote a popular fortnightly column Abracadabra on its Edit page, commenting on diverse human interest subjects ranging from business to corporate history, politics, sociology, technology and governance. Abracadabra was among the most visited columns on ET’s website.</p>
           <p>In his last role at FC, Shubhrangshu took a break from regular opinion making, but wrote insightful yearend reviews and occasional commentaries under the title MIND OF THE MAVERICK. His political and economic views can be accessed at www.mydigitalfc.com.</p>
           <p>Prior to joining The Times Group, Shubhrangshu spent 8 successful years as a business/economic reporter in various Indian publications. During those initial years in reporting assignments, Roy covered almost every economic ministry in Delhi, from agriculture and labour to civil aviation, transport, oil and natural gas to the big three ministries of commerce, industry and finance.</p>
           <p>He did a short experimental stint with TV in 1995 before shifting to ET. When the Kolkata-based Ananda Bazar Group launched one of India’s first business news programmes on Doordarshan, titled Business Breakfast, with politician Jairam Ramesh as anchor in 1995, Shubhrangshu joined the initiative to lead a team of young reporters and business analysts, in one of India’s early experiments in television reporting on business. Here, he made a successful transition from “black and white” print reporting to conceptualising stories in colour and dramatising reports with visual appeal. This subsequently helped him initiate the transition to colour designing and printing at The Economic Times, where he initially joined as Coordinating Editor. It also helped him introduce visual imagery to staid business reporting. For the first time, he launched visual drama in ET’s coverage of the general election in the summer of 1996, that went on to set the gold standard of election coverage in mainline broadsheets.</p>
           <p>Shubhrangshu joined The Asian Age as Chief of Business Bureau in 1993 as part of MJ Akbar’s core team that launched the broadsheet from New Delhi, Bombay and London on February 16, 1994. He helped set up the larger editorial team of The Asian Age; conceptualised Business Age as an independent eight-page business pull-out, the first for a general English daily in India; managed a team of young reporters and copy editors; and groomed a generation of journalists who are now successful in their individual professions.</p>
           <p>Here, he also reported extensively on the inside story of how India went on to mortgage its gold with the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in 1991 and the key players involved in that historic drama. He also reported extensively on the Enron saga, India’s first attempt at privatisation and foreign investment in the power sector, and its subsequent fallout.</p>
           <p>At The Pioneer, where he was appointed the Deputy Chief of Business Bureau in Vinod Mehta’s team in January 1993, Shubhrangshu wrote extensively on the initial years of economic reforms. He also broke the news on notorious gangster Dawood Ibrahim’s investments in the since defunct East West Airlines; and Priyanka Gandhi’s first and only brush with a professional career as teacher at a nondescript South Delhi nursery.</p>
           <p>At Business Standard (1989-92), he performed adrenaline-pumping assignments, reporting extensively on the controversy surrounding the purchase of the Airbus A-320 by the Rajiv Gandhi government; the opening up of the civil aviation sector for the first time by Arif Mohammad Khan (aviation minister in the VP Singh government), and subsequently by Madhav Rao Scindia (in the Narasimha Rao government); the portfolio management scheme fiasco by Air India and Vayudoot as part of the wider Harshad Mehta stock market scam; and the controversies surrounding Indian Airlines. He also extensively reported on the Mandal commission (caste based job reservation) agitation and the 1991 economic reforms.</p>
           <p>Roy joined the Financial Express in 1987 as a rookie after a one-month internship at the Hindustan Times as part of his PG journalism programme. His first major assignment at FE was the coverage of the farmers’ agitation in western UP under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Tikait in the winter of 1987-88.</p>
           <p>At FE, he also reported extensively on India’s policy reviews by the Rajiv Gandhi government on privatisation of the defence-industrial complex and the power sector, besides the merger of the Union ministries of industry and commerce on the lines of Japan’s MITI. All these changes became reality only over the next 25 years.</p>
           <p>Shubhrangshu has studied at well-known missionary schools.</p>
           <p>He passed ICSE (Class X) in 1980 and ISC (Class XII) in 1982.</p>
           <p>Roy graduated with Honours in Political Science from Jadavpur University, Calcutta in 1985.</p>
           <p>He belongs to the 1987 class of journalism at the Indian Institute of Mass Communications, Delhi.</p></div></div></div></div>
