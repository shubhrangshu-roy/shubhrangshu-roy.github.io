        <div class="booksReview">
        <p>This collection of poems attempts to unlock the wisdom of our ancient seers for the benefit of the layfolk, often eulogised for their resilience in the face of depredations of time, but with no one to turn to—not even the gods—for succour, mercy, and redemption, and far removed from expensive and time-consuming modern psychiatric intervention. It has nothing to do with religion or rituals; nothing to do with an exclusive or an exclusivist lifestyle. Rather, these poems seek to help us cope with the circumstances that confront us on our eventful walk through life.</p>

        <p>In Shadows of the Fragmented Moon, each poem has a hidden and unexplored facet of human trait that needs confronting to clear the path of ill-informed illusions. For, as the seers have claimed down the ages, the mind is only an aggregate of desires and nothing else. We humans are a conglomerate of our emotions and reason . . . without purpose, without a second chance. Understanding this one truth alone sets us free.</p>

        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M">A poet weaves words into a tapestry of poignancy and beauty. A seer plumbs depths, speaking truth, and pointing to the path that leads away from sorrow to freedom. Rarely do we encounter a writer, in this case a poet, who combines the beautiful with the profound, serving as both poet (kavi) and philosopher (rishi). Shubhrangshu Roy, like Borges and William Blake, transports the reader of his poetry into different realms, different layers of reality. He begins with Self, the essential question: Who am I? Who are you? This question requires bravery, a willingness to dive through the surface into dark waters.</div>

Yet it finds a guide, a teacher, a sage who takes interest and extends a welcoming word: things do have a purpose! Death, rather than being a place of darkness and chaos, has a womb-like quality. In the words of Shubhrangshu:<br><br>

            I, then, am death, that ageless ocean<br>
            In which your worlds come together in refuge.<br><br>

                        <p>A brilliant and original novel by Shubhrangshu Roy, Zara’s Witness uses fantasy, myth, science, music, poetry, and stream of consciousness to communicate deep insights on the nature of inner realtity. Zara begins her journey up in the miountains and by the river. She wonders who she is, and she is taught by creatures of the forest – a frog, a lizard, an elephant, a hyena, and a turtle – the elements, and the river. She confronts questions of being and identity and learns that willing renunciation is the essence of bliss. The book is like a prose-poem that asks to be read and re-read, while nudhing the reader to mystical truths.</p>

                          <p>Shubhrangshu Roy’s ground-breaking Zara’s Witness has rightly been called “brilliant and original” by Dr Subhash Kak, researcher, scholar, author, professor and world authority on Indo-European studies and Information Science. In impact, Zara will smile in the company of Bach’s Jonathan Livingstone Seagull, St Exupéry’s The Little Prince, Gibran’s The Prophet and Coelho’s The Alchemist. After the ersatz blossoming of Mahesh Yogi and Ravi Shankar nudged by the Beatles’ self-grafting, this is a breath of fresh air blown from India’s multi-millennial civilisation. It tests the reader’s focus and throws a challenge to finish it and, titillating dormant mechanisms fretting over the essentials of Being.</p>

                              <p>For Shubhrangshu Roy, the nature of Indian philosophy and the diverse  aspirations of it not only spirals upwards, i.e., it ascends  from  one story to another, but it is also essentially recursive. Which is to say, it is never ending and almost amounts to the same thing being told over and over again through shifts in the storytelling from generation to generation, from one millennium to another. In a sense, there is actually no ending, no conclusion. The storyteller and the story can go on and on.  This reminds us of the Neverending Story of the German writer Michael Ende (1993), who has written a similar story for children and teens. As a never-ending story, the narrator becomes part of the story and the differences between the story and the hero become indistinguishable.  Here the individual self, liberated from the illusion of identity, follows the cycles of life, death and rebirth together with the whole cosmic processes.</p>

                      <p>As per my understanding, it explains Sankhya philosophy and Patanjali Yog sutras at the same time. Sankhya has been best explained by the most impressive line in Level 1...</p>

                      <p>Presented as a letter from a father to a daughter, it is not the usual bunch of homilies that daddy hands out to his little girl.

A letter from a father to his daughter on the meaning of freedom, becoming nature and refusing to succumb to the obsessive cycles of unfreedoms. This book is an ode to her liberation, her freedom, the wind in her hair, the salt in the air, the gleam in her eyes. A beautiful philosophical tribute, which is not an escape, but a miracle waiting to happen, like magic.</p>

                      <p>“This universe, Zara, is the creation of our several desires. It is the product of our energy in motion. And when our imagination flounders, we feel sapped of energy.” Zara, enclosed in a plasma bubble, lands on the bank of the Ganges from the tongue of the glacier. She begins her life on the riverbank where the eternal question of ‘Who am I?’ drives her on a journey to the city where she reckons that she can find her purpose. But her voyage is not going to be an easy one as she confronts personal loss and materialistic pleasures. Zara’s Witness is a philosophical fantasy where Zara's story is told through the four ashram of life which guides a human towards fulfilment, happiness and spiritual liberation. This book is aimed towards anyone who is trying to find their purpose in life.</p>
                      <p>After a lot of days, I was able to read something miraculous and beautiful. This book focuses on self discovery and the challenges which one faces during a lifetime. The author’s writing is so beautiful and philosophical that it will definitely connect with an avid reader easily. It has a beautiful cover as well and I will recommend it to everyone.</p>

                      <p>We often tend to forget or take nature for granted. Every single day, mother nature gives us innumerable lessons that we skip on. Only because we are ‘too busy’ or in other words, we make unconscious decisions. But just stop for a second, look around at any organic element of nature and observe. Tell me about one lesson that you extract from it. And if you don’t get any, read this book.</p>
                      <p>The title is relevant, the cover is deep, attractive, and gives us something to imagine.</p>
                      <p>The language is simple, easy to understand, but it is the writing style that makes the book different. It is poetic, going in a flow that is boundless but knows its destiny. The philosophical lessons and the fiction story have been woven well. It is inspired by the ancient Indian manner of storytelling where the living and nonliving have a conversation to prove a philosophical or spiritual point.</p>
                      <p>Many obvious lessons have been written in an unobvious way and therefore, makes the lessons digestible and amusing. A breeze of freshness hits. Some readers may find it incomprehensible due to its ‘unconventional’ writing style.</p>
                      <p>I enjoyed this book to no limit. I can happily say that I was MESMERISED in the process after finishing this book. I had not read something like this in a very long time and it reminded me of the stories that my mother and grandmother narrated to me as a child for me to learn the lessons of life. Therefore, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something fresh, something unusual, something fictional yet something enlightening.</p>

                      <p>“Since the best way to disarm your opponent is not to make an appearance at all, it's probably best to shut the noise of your mind.”</p>
                      <p>The author, Shubhrangshu Roy has done a remarkable job in blending spirituality and fiction together in this novel. The book deploys several tools used in other crafts and science such as literature, poetry, theatre, classical Indian and Western music, cinema and quantum computing to narrate Zara's inner exploration. It is a visceral read on spiritualism in the form of fantasy fiction.</p>
                      <p>This book is a vivid portrayal of Zara's search for her purpose in life in a fairy tale setting- from the stark wilderness by the riverside, through the forest and to her destination in the city - which resonates with all of us at some level. Throughout the book, Zara is mentored by the river, the lizard, the frog, and other creatures of the forest. </p>
                      <p>The novel offers a subtle discourse on Indic philosophy and the existential questions one faces in life amalgamated with elements of spiritualism and contemporary philosophy (think Paulo Coelho or Robin Sharma). </p>
                      <p>Personally for me, the book offered a cornucopia of things to ruminate about, it was a visceral and sublime read that takes you into the true nature of being, exhorts you to break free from the manacles of the chaos in your mind and makes you ask yourself: “Who am I?”</p>

                      <p>Zara’s Witness by Shubhrangshu Roy is a fresh take in the self-help genre adding in a fantasy touch, thus making it more imaginative and colourful. The writing knits in the art of music, sound vibrations, mythology and science via nature that never fails to teach us the original lesson on how to lead a better life. However, we at times, take it all for granted.</p>
                      <p>Reading this book felt very different and gave me the Disney vibes, which through adventures, teach us numerous lessons to be authentic and to just be. The book aims for anyone who is trying to find their purpose in life. The characters break down with songs and philosophies bringing in the wave of lightness inside of you.</p>
                      <p>The extraordinary prose will transport you to Zara’s world, leave you spellbound, help you appreciate the finer nuances of life and compel you to go on a journey of self-discovery and rumination. The book is recommended to people/readers who love to read philosophical stuff. Especially for kids. This book could be a nighttime story to introduce a different universe to them to make. </p>
