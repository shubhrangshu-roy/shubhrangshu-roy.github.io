        <div class="booksReview">
        <p>This collection of poems attempts to unlock the wisdom of our ancient seers for the benefit of the layfolk, often eulogised for their resilience in the face of depredations of time, but with no one to turn to—not even the gods—for succour, mercy, and redemption, and far removed from expensive and time-consuming modern psychiatric intervention. It has nothing to do with religion or rituals; nothing to do with an exclusive or an exclusivist lifestyle. Rather, these poems seek to help us cope with the circumstances that confront us on our eventful walk through life.</p>

        <p>In Shadows of the Fragmented Moon, each poem has a hidden and unexplored facet of human trait that needs confronting to clear the path of ill-informed illusions. For, as the seers have claimed down the ages, the mind is only an aggregate of desires and nothing else. We humans are a conglomerate of our emotions and reason . . . without purpose, without a second chance. Understanding this one truth alone sets us free.</p>

        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M">A poet weaves words into a tapestry of poignancy and beauty. A seer plumbs depths, speaking truth, and pointing to the path that leads away from sorrow to freedom. Rarely do we encounter a writer, in this case a poet, who combines the beautiful with the profound, serving as both poet (kavi) and philosopher (rishi). Shubhrangshu Roy, like Borges and William Blake, transports the reader of his poetry into different realms, different layers of reality. He begins with Self, the essential question: Who am I? Who are you? This question requires bravery, a willingness to dive through the surface into dark waters.</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M byline-M italic">The ones who worship ignorance enter into blind darkness.<br>
                                                  The ones who delight in knowledge enter into darkness even greater than that!</div>
        <div class="byline">—Isha Upanishad, 9</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M">Our poet suggests that every person, every being, finds itself within the clutches of time.</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M byline-M italic">The Blessed One said:<br>
                                                I am time, bringing about the end of the world.<br>
                                                  Even if you do nothing, all the fighters will someday fail.</div>
        <div class="byline">—Bhagavad Gita XI:32</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M">The eye merely looks on; the world dances forth, unaware she is being watched. The mind and the senses churn, performing for the unseen witness.<br></div>


    </div>
    <div class="card-M"> <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M byline-M italic">She is the form of the beautiful sky, of space itself.<br>
                                                  She is seen as good fortune moving all that she holds.<br>
                                                  She is the goddess of all these various worlds that that she dances into being.<br>
                                                  All cities and continents, mountains and islands, hang on her agency as a string of gems around her neck.</div>
        <div class="byline">—Yoga Vasistha VI.II:84:19-21</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M">In the shadows, truths become known. By exploring envy and anger, reality first bites and stings. Then, in embarrassment, a purification happens. A catharsis undoes the doer, unglues the doing.</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M byline-M italic">Darkness was concealed by darkness there,<br>
                                                  Enveloped in chaos.<br>
                                                  The heat of desire stirred. An unnamed one emerged from<br>
                                                  the void.</div>
        <div class="byline">—Rig Veda X:129</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M">Shubhrangshu sees in the forest and ocean bounteous glory, evoking memories of other texts that offer praise.</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M byline-M italic">O Earth! Sacred are your hills, snowy mountains, and<br>
                                                  deep forests.</div>
        <div class="byline">—Atharva Veda, Prithivi Sukta, 11</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M byline-M italic">The Yogi, even-minded while in the world, focuses on the milky ocean.<br>
                                                  The mist of each silent, peaceful wave<br>
                                                  Resembles a garland of pearls.</div>
        <div class="byline">—Jnanarnava, 37:4</div></div>
  <div class="card-M"><div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M">In clusters of poems that evoke time, the eye, the mind, the senses, the shadows, the forest, and the ocean, Shubhrangshu invites the reader to linger, to take a second look, to cultivate the skill and craft of regard.<br><br>

        Arising from meditative moments, the mind stumbles forward in fragments as described by Shubhrangshu. Yet it finds a guide, a teacher, a sage who takes interest and extends a welcoming word: things do have a purpose! Death, rather than being a place of darkness and chaos, has a womb-like quality. In the words of Shubhrangshu:<br><br>

            I, then, am death, that ageless ocean<br>
            In which your worlds come together in refuge.<br><br>

            Death is seen as Fana, the blissful annihilation of all clinging and attachment.</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M byline-M italic">Yoga brings the stilling of awareness and action.</div>
        <div class="byline">—Yoga Sutra 1:2</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M">Time comes to an end. The deer had once listened for sound; the bull hankered for touch; the fish craved taste; the moth was drawn to the light; the bee to the wafting scent.</div>
        <div class="cardcontent-M noIMG-M byline-M italic">Now all things have been fulfilled.<br>
                                                  The end of time brings freedom.<br>
                                                  The purpose of creative vibration has been accomplished.<br>
                                                  The outflow of the world ceases.<br></div>

                    <div class="cardcontent-M"><p>With great elegance, Shubhrangshu Roy starts and ends with awareness of self. The poems explore in exquisite language the many expressions of self. This work celebrates the erasure of a discrete, grasping self as it attains an unspeakable freedom.</p></div>
