    <div class="main-body"><div class="left-book"><img src="images/Moon.png" class="center"><p>In Shadows of the Fragmented Moon, each poem has a hidden and unexplored facet of human trait that needs confronting to clear the path of ill-informed illusions. For, as the seers have claimed down the ages, the mind is only an aggregate of desires and nothing else. We humans are a conglomerate of our emotions and reason . . . without purpose, without a second chance. Understanding this one truth alone sets us free.</p></div><div class="right-book"><img src="images/Zara.jpg" class="center"><p>Zara’s witness is a philosophical fantasy where Zara's story is told through the four ashram of life which guides a human towards fulfilment, happiness and spiritual liberation. This book is aimed towards anyone who is trying to find their purpose in life. The extraordinary prose will transport you to Zara's world, leave you spellbound, help you appreciate the finer nuances of life and compel you to go on a journey of self-discovery and rumination.</p></div></div>

    <div class="storyteller-block bg-fdad"><div class="narrow"><div class="cardBig"><div class="heading"></div><div class="profile-text"><p>Shubhrangshu Roy is a bard who divides his time between the US and India. His latest work  Shadows of the Fragmented Moon (February 2022), is a composition of 108 mystic chants that navigate ancient Indic thought to plunge deep into the human psyche. His first book Zara’s Witness (March 2019) is a work of mythical literature that reimagines India’s ancient Upanishadic thought as a contemporary lore exploring the human soul.</p>

<p>Hey, Ze, a modern epic drama in two volumes, places India in the midst of its contemporary civilisational shift through an ever-changing narrative between its two protagonists, a Hindu and a Muslim, to explore an extensive and diverse range of philosophical musings from history to politics, religion, nationalism, society, employment, culture, travel, literature, poetry, music, relationships, love, hate, sex, spirituality and divinity in the everyday life of two individuals. The work is now waitlisted for publication.</p>

<p>Roy is currently working on his next major project to explain the real essence of Hinduism to Hindus. He plans to follow that work with explaining Islam to Muslims. </p>

<p>A prequel to Zara’s Witness, penetrating the deepest mysteries of the Vedas is further down the line. His other major work, The Flow (available on Facebook, and being transplanted here) is an episodic learning of Vedic wisdom through nuggets of daily thoughts covering an entire year.</p>

<p>Roy is an inspired poet. Besides his original renditions, he continues to both translate and transcreate poems from the Indian vernacular, a sampling of which is available on this website. </p>

<p>In his previous avatar, Roy was a successful business journalist in India for three decades without any formal academic grounding either in economics or business. In 2008, he launched the Financial Chronicle, until recently India's youngest business daily, as its first and last Editor-in-chief and Chief Operating Officer. In that capacity he managed a successful partnership with The International Herald Tribune, the erstwhile global edition of The New York Times, between 2008 and 2012. Roy managed the Financial Chronicle for eight years before it closed down under the weight of intellectual and financial bankruptcy of its publishers.</p>

<p>Before launching Financial Chronicle, he spent 20 years as a journalist with various Indian broadsheets, of which 12 years were spent at the Times Group, primarily in senior editorial functions at The Economic Times. He also worked at The Asian Age, The Pioneer, Business Standard and Financial Express, where he reported on some of the biggest changes in India’s economic and political history. He had a brief peep into television journalism in the early 1990s. That exposure helped him think creatively in colour.</p>

<p>Roy was known in journalism for the high standards of editorial integrity and intellectual honesty both in his personal endeavours and as team leader. Roy is a gifted writer known for his in-depth analysis of economic, social and political issues, on which, he still writes occasionally. A sampling of his past and ongoing essays are available here.</p>

<p>He was on the judges' panel of Asia's most respected journalism award, Society of Publishers in Asia -- SOPA AWARDS  for Excellence in Journalism for eight years starting 2011. He was executive producer of The First Orbit, Christopher Riley's 2011 real-time re-creation of history's first human spaceflight by Yuri Gagarin on 12th April 1961. </p>

<p>Roy, a world citizen, has travelled extensively both in India and abroad. At present, he lives in Bethesda, Maryland, USA with his wife and daughter.</p></div></div></div></div>
