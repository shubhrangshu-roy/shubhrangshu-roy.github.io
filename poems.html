      <div class="cardcontent"><br>
As in the constant battles<br>
Between good and evil,<br>
Between gods and demons,<br>
Between sky and earth,<br>
Between rain and drought,<br>
So, too, there is a never ending war<br>
Between sacred unadulterated speech <br>
And bright intense poetry.<br>
For, poetry is the mistress of deception,<br>
Endowed with the quality of the seer,<br>
Who sees...<br>
Hears...<br>
Speaks...<br>
Twisting words<br>
That are unspoken...<br>
Unheard...<br>
Unseen.<br>
Like the friseur<br>
Who grooms the tresses<br>
As companion to the fair maiden<br>
And, in doing so,<br>
Brings the dead<br>
Back to life.<br>
And in that twisting and turning<br>
Of the unrelenting war<br>
Virtue suffers a million deaths<br>
Bringing great grief.<br>
And yet, in the isolation<br>
Of that standalone win,<br>
Poetry is reduced<br>
To penury and abstinence<br>
Leaving the field barren<br>
For sacred speech<br>
To sprout once more!<br>
In a neverending<br>
Play of Shadows.<br><br><br>

      <div class="cardcontent"><br>
This is Tom. He could well be Dick.<br>
This is Pu. She could well be Puss.<br>
How did Tom and Pu get there?<br>
For heaven’s sake, they can’t quite tell.<br>
For, they never sought the road to hell.<br>
So, here’s what Dick and Puss wish to know<br>
While you cuss and curse<br>
And swear and shout.<br>
What got you going to push us in<br>
Right into the choking well; who flushed us<br>
Out the stinking drain?<br>
That nearly drowned us in trauma, pain<br>
Alive! You’ll never know, mom, how it feels<br>
To swallow all your toxic waste:<br>
Blood and acid and pee and poop<br>
While going down that constricted chute<br>
As you rant and rave.<br>
And still you wail since, long, and loud<br>
In bitterness, not knowing love<br>
Begets pain, ’fore pain begets love<br>
Suffer you did at birth no doubt; so did we.<br>
Then why still feed your shitpot woes?<br>
The memory of pain is just a thought.<br>
O mama dear! Be kind, be sweet.<br>
Why scream and scorn <br>
And us ill-treat?<br>
From (our) birth till (your) death<br>
We do not part, dear Ma, O dear!<br>
In dignity, grace let’s make fresh start.<br>

  The language of poetry traverses a wide and variegated landscape. Lament has been penned in the image and idiom of populist feminazi literature, that seeks to reduce motherhood to perverse pain and indignity of the woman’s soul in search of liberation and equality.<br>
It needn’t be so. <br>
Apart from borrowing notes from contemporary counter narrative on motherhood, the tone and tenor of this post does not seek to offend individual sensitivities.<br>
Instead, it seeks to reassert that the birth of a child is a sacred passage of a pilgrim from ‘outerspace’ to this beautiful paradise we call earth.<br>
In the four billion-year-old history of the known Universe, there is no evidence yet of life on any other planet, star or galaxy.<br>
Motherhood must necessarily mean cherishing this painful privilege of birthing new life that is sacred and worth preserving, not because it’s a woman’s bounden duty to do so, but because there is no other option.<br>
True, women must be empowered. There’s no dispute on that. Educated women deserve to fly First Class on their own terms, by their own sweat, as much as their educated spouses aspire to do. There’s no second guessing on that either.<br>
It’s then, the poor, illiterate mother who lacks an option. But, even in her suffering and pain and humiliation and sacrifice, she respects her sanctity of birthing. She’s really the one who needs a choice.<br>
Without exception, that choice of birthing, and when and how, must exclusively be the mother’s prerogative, irrespective of whether she is rich or poor, educated or illiterate.
The mother, the woman, must make that choice.<br>
But, equally, she must not denigrate that one chance of life’s regeneration in this unimaginably vast Universe, with expletives that spout forth from her flaming tongue.<br>
For, the chant alone is sacred. And the birth alone is sacred.<br>
And that sacred journey to heaven on earth must necessarily be walked through hell both by mother and child. That’s how nature ordained it at conception.<br>
There’s no other path to tread.<br>
Motherhood, above anything else, is the tunnel to reigniting the lamp of life. So that one lamp might light another.<br>
Generation after generation after generation!<br>
But to light that lamp, the wick too must burn.<br>
Generation after generation after generation!<br>
Thank you, mother, for giving me life. Thank you all mothers as well, this Mother's Day, today... and everyday!<br>

          <b>Gabriella:</b> ’Sup, sweet bitch, in your world of colour-en-scent?<br><br>

          <b>Lucifera:</b> Scorchin’, young lass, with pain of burning flesh that lusts-en-craves.<br><br>

          <b>Gabriella:</b> Aha! pretty bird, they still sing your paens at Cinema Paradiso<br>
Can’t you darn your wings back to shape?<br><br>

<b>Lucifera:</b> Ah, Gabriella! Have you heard not my magic whisper? Come, read my lips.<br>
My chalice long smashed to smithereens.<br>
For Hollywood’s sake, I can’t return to your utterly dull, plastic world, devoid of gloss-en-glam.<br>
For the one who despaired to poison this world with passion, why surrender my cravings?<br><br>

<b>Gabriella:</b> You lost your place at suppa, the last one, when you painted the Virgin naked, lowering His gaze before the fireflies.<br><br>

<b>Lucifera:</b> Glowworms? Fire ignited the glow in this spec of dust-en-dirt.<br>
He messed with me, so, my bit(t)e(r) alone concocted Adam’s heady cocktail.<br>
While you play lock(h)er room from the comfort of your couch, guess who’s caught in hellfire -- you or I?<br>
Barbie waits on me, helpless, and so does hapless Elle, as my lusty pout pummels bottle after bottle, one decanter after another, a glass once more, a sip at a time.<br>
Suffocating within your walls, go ask God, the Virgin, the Virus, this one last thing: Who coloured Adam’s drink with scarlet drops?<br>
I prick His heart with my needle eyes.<br>
And you toast: “Cheers! All-a-you! I luv U! Allahu!”<br><br><br>

I pray not to be steered<br>
Into a safe harbour<br><br>

When caught unawares<br>
In the fierce storm of life<br><br>

All I wish for instead:<br>
May I not cower in fear<br><br>

When dark calamity haunts <br>
My existence on earth<br><br>

It’s okay if you are unable<br>
To douse the flaming pain of my soul<br><br>

All I pray for, instead, is the strength<br>
To overcome my uninvited sorrow<br><br>

I ask not for you to lend me your hand.<br>
That’s fine. May my resolve not waver<br><br>

When my world is visited upon by harm<br>
And I am heaped upon with scorn<br><br>

May I never be rescued by you, my dear<br>
Just grant me the strength to soldier on<br><br>

I ask not of you to bear my burden<br>
Nor do I crave to be consoled in gloom<br><br>

All I fervently hope for is to swim<br>
Through the calamitous tide of time<br><br>

May I behold your stupendous face<br>
In the bright morning Sun forever<br><br>

But in the tipping moment of the dark night<br>
When the world rises against me in one<br><br>

May I not lose my faith one bit in you.<br>
My love!

     <div class="card"><div class="cardcontent cardTitle">Keep Walking</div>
      <div class="cardcontent"><br>
Why the heck must I falter door to door,<br>
When I carry strength on my able feet<br>
When right ahead of me there runs<br>
A long expanse of cobbled street.<br><br>

May I not rest till I reach my goal<br>
For, it’s my job... to keep walking<br>
I say something, I hear something<br>
I share some load along the way<br><br>

It’s great I got to meet you darling<br>
You helped me cover a good distance.<br>
What else should I call myself, Walker?!<br>
For, it’s my job ... to keep walking.<br><br>

Walking through this half-life of mine<br>
I gain something, I lose something<br>
Surrounded by hope ‘n’ despair<br>
I laugh sometime, I cry sometime.<br><br>

Heed: never give up, no matter what<br>
For, it’s my job...  to keep walking<br>
We wade thru the vicissitudes of time<br>
In this giant Universe we call our home<br><br>

Who else is there who does not bear<br>
Joys and sorrows of life, like u and me<br>
Why must I crib then: Time’s running against me<br>
For, it’s my job... to keep walking.<br><br>

I kept wandering door to door<br>
In search of that elusive fullness of life<br>
But, the cobbles stood up against my feet<br>
With every step I took down the street.<br>

This is what life’s about, why must I despair then<br>
For, it’s my job...  to keep walking<br>
Some walk with me along the way<br>
Others turn back halfway through<br><br>

But the momentum of life relentlessly runs<br>
Whoever falls, must fall behind<br>
Joy finally comes to the one who walks.<br>
The one and only... who keeps walking.

You are the one and the only forever

Ruination knocked down our home<br>
That’s now Zainab’s lifeless abode<br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
With Qasim-Abbas gone waste <br>
Akbar, Asghar slaughtered as well<br>
Who’s left to welcome her home?<br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
When curious neighbours begin to ask<br>
How her arm’s turned deep blue<br>
Who will she turn to? <br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
Lungs bursting, she steps indoors<br>
Remembering her dearest bro <br>
Her heart swoons with every step<br>
He’s gone to return no more <br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
Silence may speak a thousand words,<br>
But how can she do so?<br>
Without a word from brother dear <br>
Zainab can live no more.<br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab<br>
<br>
Her face unveiled, fetters unchained<br>
Even death eludes Zainab<br>
There’s no telling what suffering await …<br>
Just shudder the thought, Zainab
