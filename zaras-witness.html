    <h2>An ancient gift for the new</h2>

    <h4>A personal journey undertaken to explore the universal</h4>

    <h2>Shubhrangshu Roy</h2>

    <p>Unrestrained curiosity and an innocuous question to a media mogul took me on a wild journey on the banks of the Ganges at the foot of the Himalayas, in Haridwar, 13 years ago. I was on the verge of a burnout from years of chasing news, and submitting to deadline pressures imposed by the printed word. That perhaps, had aroused an unrelenting urge to chase the stars, to figure out what really could be the purpose of life. Who am I, after all? I asked aloud. I convinced myself that chasing the stars would be the ultimate adventure, the final act of journalism, investigating into the nature of the bewildering unknown. Up there in the sky, I could finally join the dots.</p>

    Zara’s Witness is the culmination of that quest. Scripted in bursts of mystical insights and inspiration following rigorous study of secular Indic literature, it narrates the story of a young girl’s search for the meaning of life, figuratively, along the course of an imaginary river — from high up in the mountains to just short of where it merges with the sea before rising to the sky, first as vapour, and then, as cloud, repeating the cycle of birth and death, over and over again.

    <p>For me, that journey, lasted a full 12 years — which, quite by grand coincidence, is the complete cycle from one Kumbh mela to another. It is also, by the ancient code of the ashramas in Indic life, the time that a student actually spends at the abode of his master (in the Brahmacharya ashrama), before moving forward to lead the life of a householder (Grihastha ashrama).</p>

    <p>Through those eventful, if tiring, years, I periodically drove to Haridwar, to partake in the discourses at a little known satsang or gathering of lay folk, many of them top corporate honchos, under the guidance of an evolved spiritual teacher, little known to the outside world.</p>

    <p>What I discovered there in the company of the seer (the teacher) and the seekers (on occasions, some 2,000 men and women) had so little to with the search of God -- of the One imagined, almighty, unknown, up there. And it had still little to do with the question if He was up there, for real.</p>

    <p>Instead, it had to do with our mundane pangs of everyday grind. What happens to my business? What happens to my wealth? What happens to my health? What happens to my spouse? What happens to my offspring? What happens if I die? In other words, it was all about career, wealth, health, sex, inheritors and death. And why do all of these worries, either singly or in collective, not perform to my command. That raises the trite, yet profound, question, if wishes were horses…?</p>

    <p>Zara’s Witness attempts to address those questions in a fairytale setting, by the river bank and through an enchanted forest, before culminating inside a star kitchen in a dazzling city of the bold and the beautiful. There, Zara discovers the fullness of her life’s longings. And that fullness is to be found in Universal Love!</p>

    <p>The narration draws on concepts and images from early Indic literature to contemporary Disney classics. It also imports narrative techniques from poetry, theatre, classical Indian and Western music, cinema, and quantum computing to narrate Zara’s inner exploration. </p>

    <p>Yet, this story, and the turmoil and euphoria it brings to life, is only apparent at the surface level for a first-time reader. At a deeper level, there are several underlying layers that transport readers to the inner realms of their being. And in it, is told the story of subversion, as if, by getting under the skin, to turn around the conventional wisdom handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation – that there is no merit in abstinence. No virtue in denial.</p>

    <p>At another subcutaneous level, Zara’s Witness is a simple musical score of computational mathematics and the measurement of time and distance. Of how
    one became many over a period of time. How an epoch is hidden within a moment, and how a moment is hidden within an epoch. That story is not only for a mind informed on the subtle beauty of Indic wisdom. It should also fascinate a nerd exploring the final frontiers of computing. Which is why this story is not only for those seeking spiritual liberation or for those keen on listening to the songs of their soul. It is equally relevant for the high school grad, the IIT scholar and the Silicon Valley techie, to discover the beauty of a parallel universe.</p>

    <p>A few years ago, I remember reading about Facebook’s maverick founder Mark Zuckerburg wondering aloud if there could be an equation that could explain everything in this Universe. I am not a scientist nor a technologist to be able to draw up a mathematical equation to satisfy that curiosity. But Zara’s Witness does attempt to draw up a linear stream of thought in a chapter at the end of the story titled “The Essence of This and That!,” which should take the reader on a wonderful chase into how all things fall into place, or a common (w)hole, so to speak.</p>

    <p>Above all this, the story of Zara’s inner journey, seeks to invite the 21st century Gen Z to explore the hidden world of Indian classics in their unabridged and undiluted form, to figure out for themselves how millennia old knowledge is shaping our understanding of the complex human mind even now.</p>

The lizard looked at Zara, amused, then smiled.<br>
‘You’ve got it all. You have grasped the wisdom climbing up the steps that I spent a lifetime to learn by the river’s bank...,’ she said.</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/ef-6.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">Truth, Zara,’ said the elephant winking, ‘is that that is invariant in all frames of reference. Just like me...

But to the one with complete vision, I am what I really am, an elephant...’</div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="cardcontent noIMG">Zara sat pensive. Thinking. Thinking deep. ‘What’s true? What’s untrue?’ she wondered.<br><br>
‘There’s hyacinth there... that’s true?’ she asked herself. Then, she replied. ‘No... there’s water there? That’s true?’<br><br>
‘Where's the water?’ asked the turtle testing Zara.<br><br>
Zara paused, and thought and thought and thought.<br><br>
And then, slowly, raising her voice, she said, ‘There's only truth.’<br><br>
‘Only truth?’ asked the turtle, now raising his brow...<br><br>
      Do not waste your emotions, Zara,’ the tree said. ‘Your sorrow comes from within. Solve your sorrows within. Remember, there is no joy in the material things of life. The treasure lies buried someplace else.’</div></div>

  Floating beyond the horizon of reality,<br>
<br>
  On a carpet of smoke,<br>
<br>
  I see life abound in joy.<br>
<br>
  It’s a world of goodness, beyond measure.<br>
<br>
  I leave my land far behind<br>
<br>
  Flying over the clouds<br>
<br>
  To a magical place -- I find everlasting peace.<br>
<br>
  As the gateway to knowledge opens<br>
<br>
  Revealing to me the naked truth...<br>
<br>
  I find my greatest happiness<br>
<br>
  Standing at the golden gate.<br>
<br>
  There’s nothing here, but eternity!<br>
<br>
  In my flight of fancy<br>
<br>
  Among the stars, I see no god<br>
<br>
  Nor another being.<br>
<br>
  With both my arms outstretched<br>
<br>
  Grasping the pillars of conviction,<br>
<br>
  Facing the truth<br>
<br>
  And nothing, but the truth<br>
<br>
  I, the eternal being,<br>
<br>
  The highest form of creation,<br>
<br>
  Standing all alone by myself<br>
<br>
  I see none other than me.<br>
<br>
  The rest, mere projections of that<br>
<br>
  Great unknown that manifests<br>
<br>
  As the supreme being in my mind<br>
<br>
  Ever since I came down to earth.<br>
<br>
  Rising above the mundane,<br>
<br>
  I get to understand that<br>
<br>
  There’s only existence.<br>
<br>
  Existence self-existing.<br>
<br>
  I, the eternal eye that surveys the world<br>
<br>
  And pictures myself sometimes<br>
<br>
  As an elephant, at times a frog<br>
<br>
  And yet other times as a lizard, changing colours<br>
<br>
  And still more often as my likeness,<br>
<br>
  But another than my own self<br>
<br>
  Sometimes, I see myself in twos,<br>
<br>
  At others, in threes, fours; a multitude.<br>
<br>
  I see myself in you, in you, in you!<br>
<br>
  Jo tu hai, so main hoon;<br>
<br>
  Jo main hoon, so tu hai!<br>
<br>
  And so, in one and all, I find my whole.</p>

              <p>A brilliant and original novel by Shubhrangshu Roy, Zara’s Witness uses fantasy, myth, science, music, poetry, and stream of consciousness to communicate deep insights on the nature of inner realtity. Zara begins her journey up in the miountains and by the river. She wonders who she is, and she is taught by creatures of the forest – a frog, a lizard, an elephant, a hyena, and a turtle – the elements, and the river. She confronts questions of being and identity and learns that willing renunciation is the essence of bliss. The book is like a prose-poem that asks to be read and re-read, while nudhing the reader to mystical truths.</p>

                <p>Shubhrangshu Roy’s ground-breaking Zara’s Witness has rightly been called “brilliant and original” by Dr Subhash Kak, researcher, scholar, author, professor and world authority on Indo-European studies and Information Science. In impact, Zara will smile in the company of Bach’s Jonathan Livingstone Seagull, St Exupéry’s The Little Prince, Gibran’s The Prophet and Coelho’s The Alchemist. After the ersatz blossoming of Mahesh Yogi and Ravi Shankar nudged by the Beatles’ self-grafting, this is a breath of fresh air blown from India’s multi-millennial civilisation. It tests the reader’s focus and throws a challenge to finish it and, titillating dormant mechanisms fretting over the essentials of Being.</p>

                    <p>For Shubhrangshu Roy, the nature of Indian philosophy and the diverse  aspirations of it not only spirals upwards, i.e., it ascends  from  one story to another, but it is also essentially recursive. Which is to say, it is never ending and almost amounts to the same thing being told over and over again through shifts in the storytelling from generation to generation, from one millennium to another. In a sense, there is actually no ending, no conclusion. The storyteller and the story can go on and on.  This reminds us of the Neverending Story of the German writer Michael Ende (1993), who has written a similar story for children and teens. As a never-ending story, the narrator becomes part of the story and the differences between the story and the hero become indistinguishable.  Here the individual self, liberated from the illusion of identity, follows the cycles of life, death and rebirth together with the whole cosmic processes.</p>

                      <p>I don’t usually read this kind of ‘fantasy', so it took me a while to settle into the rhythm and let myself be taken along rather than try to rationalise everything and keep pace with what was what.</p>
                      <p>Once I relaxed into the fact that the story was unexpected and fanciful I became comfortably accustomed. Thank you for the opportunity to try something new.</p>
                      <p>I particularly liked “The Essence of This and That”</p>
                      <p>“This Space is Time” very interesting</p>
                      <p>“Nothing Stirs”</p>
                      <p>These were cumulatively very helpful, a gentle assisting hand. Perhaps, if I’d read these three first I would not have wallowed so much at the start.</p>
                      <p>I’m very impressed, Roy. </p>
                      <p>My impression is that you’ve written this book for a market who have both a spiritual inquisitiveness (at least) and those who love the idea of escapism for a period of time into another realm.</p>
                      <p>I think you’ve achieved this.</p>

            <p>Zara’s Witness is irreverent and inspiring at the same time. It is an imaginative rendering of Vedantic and yogic philosophy. It is fresh, attractive, humorous and witty. What has been presented through this simple story is actually Vedantic concept of negation, according to which every person has to go through the inessential, before he can outgrow the limitations imposed on him by his nature.</p>
            <p>As per my understanding, it explains Sankhya philosophy and Patanjali Yog sutras at the same time. Sankhya has been best explained by the most impressive line in Level 1...</p>

            <p>“This universe, Zara, is the creation of our several desires. It is the product of our energy in motion. And when our imagination flounders, we feel sapped of energy.” Zara, enclosed in a plasma bubble, lands on the bank of the Ganges from the tongue of the glacier. She begins her life on the riverbank where the eternal question of ‘Who am I?’ drives her on a journey to the city where she reckons that she can find her purpose. But her voyage is not going to be an easy one as she confronts personal loss and materialistic pleasures. Zara’s Witness is a philosophical fantasy where Zara's story is told through the four ashram of life which guides a human towards fulfilment, happiness and spiritual liberation. This book is aimed towards anyone who is trying to find their purpose in life.</p>
            <p>After a lot of days, I was able to read something miraculous and beautiful. This book focuses on self discovery and the challenges which one faces during a lifetime. The author’s writing is so beautiful and philosophical that it will definitely connect with an avid reader easily. It has a beautiful cover as well and I will recommend it to everyone.</p>

            <p>We often tend to forget or take nature for granted. Every single day, mother nature gives us innumerable lessons that we skip on. Only because we are ‘too busy’ or in other words, we make unconscious decisions. But just stop for a second, look around at any organic element of nature and observe. Tell me about one lesson that you extract from it. And if you don’t get any, read this book.</p>
            <p>The title is relevant, the cover is deep, attractive, and gives us something to imagine.</p>
            <p>The language is simple, easy to understand, but it is the writing style that makes the book different. It is poetic, going in a flow that is boundless but knows its destiny. The philosophical lessons and the fiction story have been woven well. It is inspired by the ancient Indian manner of storytelling where the living and nonliving have a conversation to prove a philosophical or spiritual point.</p>
            <p>Many obvious lessons have been written in an unobvious way and therefore, makes the lessons digestible and amusing. A breeze of freshness hits. Some readers may find it incomprehensible due to its ‘unconventional’ writing style.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed this book to no limit. I can happily say that I was MESMERISED in the process after finishing this book. I had not read something like this in a very long time and it reminded me of the stories that my mother and grandmother narrated to me as a child for me to learn the lessons of life. Therefore, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something fresh, something unusual, something fictional yet something enlightening.</p>

            <p>“Since the best way to disarm your opponent is not to make an appearance at all, it's probably best to shut the noise of your mind.”</p>
            <p>The author, Shubhrangshu Roy has done a remarkable job in blending spirituality and fiction together in this novel. The book deploys several tools used in other crafts and science such as literature, poetry, theatre, classical Indian and Western music, cinema and quantum computing to narrate Zara's inner exploration. It is a visceral read on spiritualism in the form of fantasy fiction.</p>
            <p>This book is a vivid portrayal of Zara's search for her purpose in life in a fairy tale setting- from the stark wilderness by the riverside, through the forest and to her destination in the city - which resonates with all of us at some level. Throughout the book, Zara is mentored by the river, the lizard, the frog, and other creatures of the forest. </p>
            <p>The novel offers a subtle discourse on Indic philosophy and the existential questions one faces in life amalgamated with elements of spiritualism and contemporary philosophy (think Paulo Coelho or Robin Sharma). </p>
            <p>Personally for me, the book offered a cornucopia of things to ruminate about, it was a visceral and sublime read that takes you into the true nature of being, exhorts you to break free from the manacles of the chaos in your mind and makes you ask yourself: “Who am I?”</p>

            <p>Zara’s Witness by Shubhrangshu Roy is a fresh take in the self-help genre adding in a fantasy touch, thus making it more imaginative and colourful. The writing knits in the art of music, sound vibrations, mythology and science via nature that never fails to teach us the original lesson on how to lead a better life. However, we at times, take it all for granted.</p>
            <p>Reading this book felt very different and gave me the Disney vibes, which through adventures, teach us numerous lessons to be authentic and to just be. The book aims for anyone who is trying to find their purpose in life. The characters break down with songs and philosophies bringing in the wave of lightness inside of you.</p>
            <p>The extraordinary prose will transport you to Zara’s world, leave you spellbound, help you appreciate the finer nuances of life and compel you to go on a journey of self-discovery and rumination. The book is recommended to people/readers who love to read philosophical stuff. Especially for kids. This book could be a nighttime story to introduce a different universe to them to make. </p>
