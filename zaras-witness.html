        <p>Zara’s Witness is a story of the soul’s journey in search of identity. That journey meanders along the course of a river through an enchanted forest before culminating in a star kitchen in the heart of a stunning city of the bold and the beautiful, where Zara finds fullness of her life’s longings in Universal Love.</p>

<p>Scripted in bursts of mystical insights and inspiration following rigorous study of secular Indic literature,  it imports narrative techniques from poetry, theatre, classical Indian and Western music, cinema,  Disney Classics and quantum computing to narrate Zara’s inner exploration.</p>

<p>Zara’s Witness is a simple musical score of computational mathematics and the measurement of time and distance. Of how one becomes many over a period of time. Of how an epoch is hidden within a moment, and a moment within an era. That story is not only for a mind informed on the subtle beauty of Indic wisdom; it should also fascinate a nerd exploring the final frontiers of computing.</p>


<p>This story is not only for those seeking spiritual liberation or for those keen on listening to the songs of their soul. It is equally relevant for the high school grad, the university scholar and the Silicon Valley techie navigating the beauty of a parallel universe.</p>

<div class="dearZara2">Dear Zara, this book is for you, but it’s not your story. It is more of a coming-of-age manual for you as you step into your teens today.</div>

<div class="cards">
  <div class="card"><img src="images/ef-1.jpg"><div class="cardcontent cardTitle">The Enchanted Forest</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/ef-3.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">Zara raised her hands, running them through her long auburn hair, and slipped into the water chanting, ‘Give up, give up, give up!’</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/ef-4.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">Come, let me show you around my parlour. It’s remarkably quiet today,’ said the big fish and both glided into midstream with the current. Zara rising once in a while to the surface to catch her breath...</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/ef-5.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">On the bank across the river at the feet of the Ah!nandita Hills... A crocodile basked in the sunshine at a distance, brooding over a batch of eggs...</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/ef-2.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">'O Lizzy! You have learnt to look at the glass half empty, but you still need to fill up your tumbler before your wisdom can flow like Rivah!'<br>
The lizard looked at Zara, amused, then smiled.<br>
‘You’ve got it all. You have grasped the wisdom climbing up the steps that I spent a lifetime to learn by the river’s bank...,’ she said.</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/ef-6.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">Truth, Zara,’ said the elephant winking, ‘is that that is invariant in all frames of reference. Just like me... To the creature with a limited vision, I might appear, at once, log; at others, a pillar or two or four; <br>sometimes, a rope or even a barrel. But to the one with complete vision, I am what I really am, an elephant...’</div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="cardcontent noIMG">Zara sat pensive. Thinking. Thinking deep. ‘What’s true? What’s untrue?’ she wondered.<br><br>
‘There’s hyacinth there... that’s true?’ she asked herself. Then, she replied. ‘No... there’s water there? That’s true?’<br><br>
‘Where's the water?’ asked the turtle testing Zara.<br><br>
Zara paused, and thought and thought and thought.<br><br>
And then, slowly, raising her voice, she said, ‘There's only truth.’<br><br>
‘Only truth?’ asked the turtle, now raising his brow...<br><br>
      Do not waste your emotions, Zara,’ the tree said. ‘Your sorrow comes from within. Solve your sorrows within. Remember, there is no joy in the material things of life. The treasure lies buried someplace else.’</div></div>

  <div class="card"><img src="images/food-1.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">Food, Zara, is the highest state of being ... for truly, food is life.<br><br>
  Know well, Zara, those who kill don’t eat; those who eat don't kill.</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/fd-2.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">Zara was only beginning to grasp what was on offer when Nigella interrupted her, peeling an onion: ‘Don’t get taken up by the broth, Zara. When you peel an onion to its end, you are only left with its essence. That essence alone is you. Your name and identity are only your skins. Sometimes they grow and sometimes they shrink. It’s only when you peel the skins, that you reach your essence. And from that essence another onion is born. So, feel the essence of your soul, Zara.</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/fd-3.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">Food, Zara, is the highest state of being. For, truly life is food.<br><br>

When you are starved of food, you cease to feel, you cease to smell, you cease to hear, you cease to speak, you cease to see, you cease to think, you cease to<br><br>

And when you get to eat, life blooms in you. And you begin to think, you begin to speak, you begin to see, you begin to touch, you begin to hear, you begin to smell, you begin to feel.</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/fd-4.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">And this, indeed, is the food, that you and I hanker after. So, fear not darling, and hate me not. From food are all creatures born, by food they grow and live.</div></div>
  <div class="card"><img src="images/fd-5.jpg"><div class="cardcontent">From food are creatures, that dwell on earth, produced; by food they live and again into it, they finally pass.<br><br>
      I am food! I am food, I am food.<br><br>

I am the eater of food! I am the eater of food, I am the eater of food.</div></div>

  Floating beyond the horizon of reality,<br>
<br>
  On a carpet of smoke,<br>
<br>
  I see life abound in joy.<br>
<br>
  It’s a world of goodness, beyond measure.<br>
<br>
  I leave my land far behind<br>
<br>
  Flying over the clouds<br>
<br>
  To a magical place -- I find everlasting peace.<br>
<br>
  As the gateway to knowledge opens<br>
<br>
  Revealing to me the naked truth...<br>
<br>
  I find my greatest happiness<br>
<br>
  Standing at the golden gate.<br>
<br>
  There’s nothing here, but eternity!<br>
<br>
  In my flight of fancy<br>
<br>
  Among the stars, I see no god<br>
<br>
  Nor another being.<br>
<br>
  With both my arms outstretched<br>
<br>
  Grasping the pillars of conviction,<br>
<br>
  Facing the truth<br>
<br>
  And nothing, but the truth<br>
<br>
  I, the eternal being,<br>
<br>
  The highest form of creation,<br>
<br>
  Standing all alone by myself<br>
<br>
  I see none other than me.<br>
<br>
  The rest, mere projections of that<br>
<br>
  Great unknown that manifests<br>
<br>
  As the supreme being in my mind<br>
<br>
  Ever since I came down to earth.<br>
<br>
  Rising above the mundane,<br>
<br>
  I get to understand that<br>
<br>
  There’s only existence.<br>
<br>
  Existence self-existing.<br>
<br>
  I, the eternal eye that surveys the world<br>
<br>
  And pictures myself sometimes<br>
<br>
  As an elephant, at times a frog<br>
<br>
  And yet other times as a lizard, changing colours<br>
<br>
  And still more often as my likeness,<br>
<br>
  But another than my own self<br>
<br>
  Sometimes, I see myself in twos,<br>
<br>
  At others, in threes, fours; a multitude.<br>
<br>
  I see myself in you, in you, in you!<br>
<br>
  Jo tu hai, so main hoon;<br>
<br>
  Jo main hoon, so tu hai!<br>
<br>
  And so, in one and all, I find my whole.</p>
